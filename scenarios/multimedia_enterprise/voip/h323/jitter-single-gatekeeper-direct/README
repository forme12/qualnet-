PURPOSE:-
--------
In this scenario, there is one VOIP application 
started at 4 Minute from Node-1 to Node-6 and ended at 14 Minute.
Here encoding scheme is G.711 and Packetization Interval 
is 20milli second.

To test whether VOIP application with Jitter Buffer can run perfectly 
with the support of one gatekeeper and make call signals
direct from initiator to receiver.

SCENARIO:-
---------
In this scenario, there is one VOIP application.
