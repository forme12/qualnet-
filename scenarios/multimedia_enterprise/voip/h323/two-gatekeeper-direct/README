PURPOSE:-
--------
In this scenario, there is one VOIP application 
started at 5 Minute from Node-1 to Node-20 and ended at 7 Minute.
Here default encoding scheme is G.711 and Packetization Interval 
is 20milli second.

To test whether VOIP application with Jitter Buffer runs perfectly 
with the support of two gatekeepers and can make call
signals direct from initiator to receiver.


SCENARIO:-
---------
In this scenario, there is one VOIP application.
