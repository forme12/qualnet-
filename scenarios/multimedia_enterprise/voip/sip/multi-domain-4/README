PURPOSE:-
--------
checks proper call set up and release in multiple domains
when calls are made concurrently and across several domains.
The test is made here for a scenario involving 4 domains.


SCENARIO:-
---------
In this scenario, VOIP application of node 1 and node 2 makes two
call attempts to that of node 9 and 12 of different domain respectively
at the same time. Both calls should mature.


() :  represents a node, and the number within indicates
      the nodeId.
