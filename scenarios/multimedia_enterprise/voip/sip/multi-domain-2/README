PURPOSE:-
--------
checks proper call set up and  release between a set of nodes belonging
to two domains.

SCENARIO:-
---------
In this scenario, VOIP applications of nodes 1 thru 4 of first domain 
make calls to nodes 7 thru 10 of second domain. After sometime the call
attempts are made from the same  set of nodes of domain2 to the same set
of nodes of domain1.It may be noted, link bandwidth may be increased
properly for link 5-6 as it is heavily loaded for this scenario to
successfully establish all calls.


() :  represents a node, and the number within indicates
      the nodeId.
