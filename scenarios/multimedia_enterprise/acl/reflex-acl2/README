PURPOSE:-
--------
Reflexive access lists can be configured on border routers
that pass traffic between an internal and external network.
The word "internal network" refers to a network that is
controlled (secured), such as some a part of the organization's
internal network that has higher security requirements than another part.
"External network" refer to a network that is uncontrolled (unsecured)
such as the Internet or to a part of the organization's network that is
not as highly secured.
