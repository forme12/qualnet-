PURPOSE:-
--------

This scenario verifies that QOSPF finds the best path from source to
destination and that this path is 'pinned down' throughout the session.

SCENARIO:-
---------

In this scenario, a link fault occurs on the link between nodes 2 and 4
from 8 minutes into the simulation to 14 minutes into the simulation.  The
TRAFFIC-GEN session starts before the fault occurs. Another TRAFFIC-GEN
session starts during the fault. The first session gets fixed to the
original best path throughout the entire simulation. So all the packets
transmitted during the link fault will be dropped for this session.
All of the second session's packets will reach to destination, as it is
assigned the second path.
