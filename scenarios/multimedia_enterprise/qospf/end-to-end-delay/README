PURPOSE:-
--------
This scenario verifies that QOSPF is able to check whether bandwidth and
end-to-end delay can be satisfied by providing a path for a session. It
shows that QOSPF can predict the propagation delay that will be suffered
by the session. But the protocol cannot predict the queue delays that will
be suffered during transmission.

SCENARIO:-
---------
A CBR session starts between two intermediate nodes of a path through which
the TRAFFIC-GEN session transmits. So while the request for QoS was
previously satisfied, traffic delays will begin to exceed the required bounds.
