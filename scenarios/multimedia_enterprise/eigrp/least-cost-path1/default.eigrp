# To Enable EIGRP Router following statement must be given.
#
# ROUTER <node-id> <as-id>
#
# Each router (that will run EIGRP) MUST be configured with all the
# networks DIRECTLY attached to it. NETWORK statement is used to
# configure a router with it's directly attached networks. If router
# is connected with networks, whose ip addresses are ip1, ip2 and ip3,
# then following NETWORK statement is used - and also each network
# must be followed by its corresponding subnet mask address.
#
# NETWORK <ip1> <subnet-mask1>
# NETWORK <ip2> <subnet-mask2>
# NETWORK <ip3> <subnet-mask3>
#
# The configuration parameters described below are optional. If they
# are not given default values are used.
#
# To enable/disable IP split horizon set the following configuration
# parameter:
# IP-SPLIT-HORIZON
# or
# NO-IP-SPLIT-HORIZON
#
# To enable/disable poison reverse set the following configuration
# parameter:
# EIGRP-POISON-REVERSE  ON | OFF.
#
# EIGRP Timers:
# One can set EIGRP hello and hold timer values.These timer values
# are interface specific. If this values are not set a default
# value is assumed. An example setting is as below
#
# EIGRP-HOLD-TIME       1  5S
# EIGRP-HELLO-INTERVAL  1 10S
#
# EIGRP Route filtering:
# EIGRP route filtering can be done using DISTRIBUTE-LIST command.
# Format of the command is as below:
# DISTRIBUTE-LIST <ACL-list/number> <interface type (IN/OUT)>
# DISRTIBUTE-LIST <interface type (IN/OUT)> <interface index>
# Here <ACL-list/number> specifies an access list name/number that
# suppose to exist in the router configuration file.
#
# Example1:
# DISTRIBUTE-LIST EigrpFilter1 OUT
# DISTRIBUTE-LIST EigrpFilter1 OUT 1
#
# Where "EigrpFilter1" is an Access List specification that suppose
# to exist in router configuration file.
#
# Example2:
# ROUTER  5 1
# NETWORK 0.0.5.0   255.255.255.252
# NETWORK 0.0.1.0   255.255.255.252
# NETWORK 0.0.2.0   255.255.255.252
# DISTRIBUTE-LIST Router5-ACL  OUT
# DISTRIBUTE-LIST Router5-ACL  OUT 0
# DISTRIBUTE-LIST Router5-ACL  OUT 1
# Distribute list named "Router5-ACL" is specified at more
# than one interfaces (interface 1 and 0)
#
# The IP-ROUTE command. The syntax of the command is as follows:
# IP-ROUTE <prefix> <mask> <address>
# where prefix is the address of the network you are
# creating a route for, mask is the mask for this network,
# and address is the IP address of the interface you are
# routing the packets to. For all of the eigrp routers
# except the exit router (the one connected to the core)
# use the following command to create the default route.
# ip route 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 156.156.15.1
#
# Example:
# ROUTER  1 1
# NETWORK 0.0.1.0    255.255.255.252
# NETWORK 0.0.100.0  255.255.255.0
# IP-ROUTE 0.0.0.0  0.0.0.0  0.0.1.1
# This means router 1 has a default route thru the interface whose
# IP address is 0.0.1.1.
# One can also use it to specify a static route.
#
# IP-DEFAULT-NETWORK <network-address>
# It is used to specify a default network address. The default
# network will be used for default-candidate routing.
#
# Route summarization related commands:
# There are two commands related to route summarization. They are
# 1) NO-AUTO-SUMMARY and
# 2) AUTO-SUMMARY
# EIGRP by default summarizes route, so AUTO-SUMMARY is the default
# value. To stop auto summarization at a particular node one can
# give NO-AUTO-SUMMERY command.
#
# Example1
# ROUTER  2 1
# NETWORK 131.7.0.0   255.255.0.0
# NETWORK 172.16.0.0  255.255.0.0
# NO-AUTO-SUMMARY
# This means router 2 has turned its auto summarization feature off.
#
# Example2
# ROUTER  2 1
# NETWORK 131.7.0.0   255.255.0.0
# NETWORK 172.16.0.0  255.255.0.0
# AUTO-SUMMARY
# Sence by default EIGRP summarizes route "AUTO-SUMMARY" option is
# redundent here.
#
# Example3
# ROUTER  2 1
# NETWORK 131.7.0.0   255.255.0.0
# NETWORK 172.16.0.0  255.255.0.0
# AUTO-SUMMARY
# NO-AUTO-SUMMARY
# In this type of configurations last option will work.
