PURPOSE
-------
To test EIGRP's route filtering property.

    N8-4.0
   (11)--+

         |     N2-1.0   N2-2.0   N2-3.0
   (21)--+--(1)------(2)------(3)------(4)
         |            |
         |            |
   (41)--+            |N2-5.0
                      |
                     (5)



Node 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 are EIGRP routers. Node 11, 21, and 41 are
hosts and belong to subnet N8-4.0. Router 1 belongs to both
the subnets 4.0 and 1.0.

Distribute list out at node 2 is specified such that it will filter
out the route 0.0.4.0/8 while sending update to the node 3.
Thus the route 0.0.4.0/8 will not propagate to node 3 and onwards.
But it will not filter out the route while advertising it to node 5.
Thus node 5 will have 0.0.4.0 but not node 3 or 4.
