# CONFIGURATION FILE FOR DEFINING ACL CRITERIAS
#
# Inputs in this file are case insensitive.
#
# Node-id of node where access list is defined.
# ROUTER <node-id>
# NOTE: This line is required only if a common ACL configuration file
# is provided for all the nodes.
#
# Interface index of node where ACL is to be configured.
# INTERFACE <interface-index>
# NOTE: Access list is applied to that interface which is defined by last
# INTERFACE keyword in the current configuration file.
#
# The rest all the configurations for standard, extended and reflex ACL
# follow the CISCO format. For detailed configuration proposals, refer
# to the user's manual.
#
# For static and standard access list, use the following reference:
