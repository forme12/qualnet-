Node 2 will summarize its routes as 10.1.0.0, node 6 will summarize its
route as 10.6.0.0 and they will advertise it. Now consider node 1 it is
connected to the networks 10.2.1.0, 10.3.1.0, and 10.4.1.0. These routes
along with the summarized routes advertised by node 2 and 6 could be
summarized as 10.0.0.0 and could be advertised to the adjacent node. But
node 1 will not do it until and unless network 10.x.y.z appears in the
network statement of the EIGRP configuration. Notice that routes are
summarized at node 2 and 6 by ACL specification.
