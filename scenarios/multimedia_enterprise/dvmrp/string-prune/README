PURPOSE:-
-------
To test the prune operation of DVMRP in a string topology network.
The multicast receiver will not received all data sent by the source
since the receiver leaves the group early, causing a prune.



SCENARIO:-
---------
In this scenario, there is one MCBR session, with node 1 being the multicast
source and node 5 being the multicast receiver.  Node 5 joins the group at
1 minute and leaves at 12 minutes of the simulation time. Node 4 is the IGMP
router. The link capacity is 10 Mbps for all links.


1 ------- 2 ------- 3 ------- 4 ------- 5


MCBR is used to transfer 50 data segments of 1000B each at 5 second
intervals starting at 10 minutes of the simulation time.



RUN:-
----

Run '<QUALNET_HOME>/bin/qualnet string-prune.config'.
