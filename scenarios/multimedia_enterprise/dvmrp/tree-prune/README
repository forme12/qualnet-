PURPOSE:-
-------
To test the prune operation of DVMRP in a tree topology network. In this
scenario, some receivers will not receive all the data sent by the source
since these receivers leave the group early (thus leading to pruning).



SCENARIO:-
---------
In this scenario, there is one MCBR session, with node 1 being the multicast
source and nodes 5, 7, 8 and 9 being the multicast receivers. All multicast
receivers join the group before the source sends data. However, nodes 8 and
9 leave the group early. Nodes 2, 3 and 4 are the IGMP routers. The link
capacity is 10 Mbps for all links.

MCBR is used to transfer 240 data segments of 1000B each at 5 second
intervals starting at 10 minutes into the simulation.
