PURPOSE:-
-------
To test the operation of DVMRP in a tree topology network.



SCENARIO:-
---------
In this scenario, there is one MCBR session, with node 1 being the multicast
source and nodes 5, 7, 8 and 9 being the multicast receivers. The multicast
receivers join the group before the source sends data. Nodes 2, 3 and 4 are
the IGMP routers. The link capacity is 10 Mbps for all links.

MCBR is used to transfer 25 data segments of 1000B each at 5 second
intervals starting at 10 minutes of the simulation time.
