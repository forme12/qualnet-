PURPOSE:-
-------
To test the graft operation of DVMRP in a string topology network.
The multicast receiver will receive most, but not all, the data
sent since the receiver leaves the group and rejoins .
(causing prunes and grafts).



SCENARIO:-
---------
In this scenario, there is one MCBR session, with node 1 being the multicast
source and node 5 being the multicast receiver.  Node 5 joins the group at
1 minute and leaves at 13 minutes of the simulation time. The receiver then
rejoins the group at 17 minutes of the simulation time. Node 4 is the IGMP
router. The link capacity is 10 Mbps for all links.


1 ------- 2 ------- 3 ------- 4 ------- 5


MCBR is used to transfer 240 data segments of 1000B each at 5 second
intervals starting at 10 minutes of the simulation time.



RUN:-
----

Run '<QUALNET_HOME>/bin/qualnet string-graft.config'.
