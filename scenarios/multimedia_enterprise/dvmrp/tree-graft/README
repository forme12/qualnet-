PURPOSE:-
-------
To test the graft operation of DVMRP in a tree topology network.  In this
scenario, some receivers will not receive all the data sent by the source
since these receivers leave the group early (thus leading to pruning)
and then rejoin the group (thus leading to grafting).



SCENARIO:-
---------
In this scenario, there is one MCBR session, with node 1 being the multicast
source and nodes 5, 7, 8 and 9 being the multicast receivers. The multicast
receivers join the group before the source sends data. However, nodes 8 and
9 will temporarily leave the group later and again rejoin after some time.
Nodes 2, 3 and 4 are the IGMP routers. The link capacity is 10 Mbps for all
links.

MCBR is used to transfer 240 data segments of 1000B each at 5 second
intervals starting at 10 minutes of the simulation time.
