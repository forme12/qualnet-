PURPOSE:-
--------
To test the unnumbered interface functionality when a nodes have multiple path
to a destination.


SCENARIO:-
---------
                          (3) - - - - -(4)
                           |            |

Nodes 3 and 2 are in a wireless subnet. Nodes 2 and 3 are connected
through Nodes 1 and 4 by another wired point to point link.All the interfaces except
0th interface of all nodes are configured as unnumbered.

A CBR application is configured between nodes 1 and 4.


RUN:-
----
Run '<QUALNET_HOME>/bin/qualnet unnumber-best-path.config'.

DESCRIPTION OF THE FILES:-
-------------------------
1. unnumber-best-path.app -  QualNet configuration file for application input.
2. unnumber-best-path.config - QualNet configuration input file.
3. unnumber-best-path.nodes - QualNet node placement file for the simulation run.
4. unnumber-best-path.expected.stat - QualNet statistics collection.
5. README - This file.
