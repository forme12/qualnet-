PURPOSE:-
--------
To Test the unnumbered interfaces functionality when two nodes have 
connectivity to each other via two different unnumbered point-to-point 
links such that if a link is broken, the packet can reach via other link.


SCENARIO:-
---------

                              |
                              |- - (4)
 (3) - - - (1) - - - (2)- - - |
                              |

Nodes 2 and 4 are connected in wireless subnet. Nodes 3, 2 and 1 are connected by wired 
point to point link.Interface 1 of Nodes 2, 3 and 4 are configured as unnumbered.
One CBR applications are configured as below:

A CBR application is configured between interface 192.0.2.2 and Interface 192.0.0.1.

RUN:-
----
Run '<QUALNET_HOME>/bin/qualnet unnumber-multiple-links.config'.

DESCRIPTION OF THE FILES:-
-------------------------
1. unnumber-multiple-links.app -  QualNet configuration file for application input.
2. unnumber-multiple-links.config - QualNet configuration input file.
3. unnumber-multiple-links.nodes - QualNet node placement file for the simulation run.
4. unnumber-multiple-links.expected.stat - QualNet statistics collection.
5. unnumber-multiple-links.fault - QualNet fault configuration file.
6. README - This file.
