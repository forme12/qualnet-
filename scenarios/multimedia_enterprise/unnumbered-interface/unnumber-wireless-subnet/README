Nodes 1 to 4 are connected in wired subnet. Nodes 2, 8 and 4, 9 and 1, 7 and 6, 3
are connected by wired point to point link. Interface 1 of all the Nodes are 
configured as unnumbered. Three CBR applications are configured as under.

Three CBR application is configured between Nodes 6 and 1, 6 and 9 and 6 and 5.

RUN:-
----
Run '<QUALNET_HOME>/bin/qualnet unnumber-wireless-subnet.config'.
