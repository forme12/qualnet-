PURPOSE:
-------
To show the graft operation of MOSPF in an inter-area topology.  In this
scenario, some receivers will not receive all the data sent by the source
since these receivers leave the group early (thus leading to pruning)
and then rejoin the group (thus leading to grafting).



SCENARIO:
---------
In this scenario, there is one MCBR session, with node 5 being the multicast
source and nodes 2, 6, 7 and 9 being the multicast group members.
The multicast group members join the group before the source sends data.
However, nodes 7 and 9 later temporarily leave the group and rejoin
at a later time. Nodes 4, 8, 12 and 13 are the IGMP routers.
Nodes 4, 8, and 12 are the Inter Area Multicast Forwarder.

MCBR is used to transfer data segments of 512B each at 30 second intervals
until the end of the simulation. Starting at 10 minutes into the simulation.
