PURPOSE:
-------
To show the graft operation of MOSPF in a tree topology network.  In this 
scenario, some receivers will not receive all the data sent by the source
since these receivers leave the group early (thus leading to pruning)
and then rejoin the group (thus leading to grafting).



SCENARIO:
---------
In this scenario, there is one MCBR session, with node 1 being the multicast
source and nodes 5, 7, 8 and 9 being the multicast receivers.  
The multicast receivers join the group before the source sends data.
However, nodes 5 and 7 later temporarily leave the group and rejoin
at a later time.  Nodes 2, 3 and 4 are the IGMP routers.
The link capacity is 10 Mbps for all links.

MCBR is used to transfer 240 data segments of 1000B each at 5 second intervals
starting at 10 minutes into the simulation.
