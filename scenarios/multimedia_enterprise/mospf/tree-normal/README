PURPOSE:
-------
To show the operation of MOSPF in a tree topology network.



SCENARIO:
---------
In this scenario, there is one MCBR session, with node 1 being the multicast
source and nodes 5, 7, 8 and 9 being the multicast receivers.  
The multicast receivers join the group before the source sends data.
Nodes 2, 3 and 4 are the IGMP routers.
The link capacity is 10 Mbps for all links.

MCBR is used to transfer 25 data segments of 1000B each at 5 second intervals
starting at 10 minutes into the simulation.



RUN:
-------

Run '<QUALNET_HOME>/bin/qualnet tree-normal.config'.
