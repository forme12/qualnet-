PURPOSE:
-------
To show the graft operation of MOSPF in a string topology network.
The multicast receiver will receive most, but not all, the data sent since
the receiver leaves the group in-between the joins (causing prunes and grafts).



SCENARIO:
---------
In this scenario, there is one MCBR session, with node 1 being the multicast
source and node 5 being the multicast receiver.  Node 5 joins the group
1 minute into the simulation and leaves at 13 minutes into the simulation.
The receiver then rejoins the group 17 minutes into the simulation.
Node 4 is the IGMP router.
The link capacity is 10 Mbps for all links.


1 ------- 2 ------- 3 ------- 4 ------- 5


MCBR is used to transfer 240 data segments of 1000B each at 5 second intervals
starting at 10 minutes into the simulation.



RUN:
-------

Run '<QUALNET_HOME>/bin/qualnet string-graft.config'.


DESCRIPTION OF THE FILES:
-------------------------
1. string-graft.app -  specifies the application being used.
2. string-graft.config - the QualNet configuration input file.
3. string-graft.member - specifies the multicast group.
4. string-graft.stat - QualNet statistics collection for MCBR and MOSPF.
5. README - this file.
