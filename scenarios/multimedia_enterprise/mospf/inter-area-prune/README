PURPOSE:
-------
To show the prune operation of MOSPF in an inter-area topology. In this
scenario, some receivers will not receive all the data sent by the source
since these receivers leave the group early (thus leading to pruning).



SCENARIO:
---------
In this scenario, there is one MCBR session, with node 5 being the multicast
source and nodes 2, 6, 7 and 9 being the multicast group members.
The multicast members join the group before the source sends data.
However, nodes 7 and 9 leave the group early.
Nodes 4, 8, 12 and 13 are the IGMP routers.
Nodes 4, 8, and 12 are the Inter Area Multicast Forwarder.

MCBR is used to transfer data segments of 512B each at 30 second intervals
until the end of the simulation. Starting at 10 minutes into the simulation.
