PURPOSE:
-------
To show the operation of MOSPF in a string topology network.



SCENARIO:
---------
In this scenario, there is one MCBR session, with node 1 being the multicast
source and node 5 being the multicast receiver.  Node 4 is the IGMP router.
The link capacity is 10Mbps for all links.



1 ------- 2 ------- 3 ------- 4 ------- 5


MCBR is used to transfer 25 data segments of 1000B each at 5 second intervals
starting at 10 minutes into the simulation.



RUN:
-------

Run '<QUALNET_HOME>/bin/qualnet string-normal.config'.


DESCRIPTION OF THE FILES:
-------------------------
1. string-normal.app -  specifies the application being used.
2. string-normal.config - the QualNet configuration input file.
3. string-normal.member - specifies the multicast group.
4. string-normal.stat - QualNet statistics collection for MCBR and MOSPF.
5. README - this file.
