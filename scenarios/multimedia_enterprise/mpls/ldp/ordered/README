PURPOSE:-
-------
Showing operation of MPLS-LDP when Label Distribution Control Mode
is Ordered.

SCENARIO:-
---------

(1)----(2)----(3)----(4)

1) Node 1,2,3 and 4 are Label-Switched-Routers (LSR).
2) Label Distribution Control Mode for each node is Independent.
3) Nodes are connected by point to point links as shown above.

If Label Distribution control mode is "Ordered", then a node generates
a label mapping if and only if a label mapping is available from
previous hop (unless it is terminator node). So there will be no data
packets drop due to "bad label".


APPLICATIONS:-
-------------

RUN:-
----
