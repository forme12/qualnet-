PURPOSE:-
--------
Showing the operation of MPLS-LDP when Label Distribution Control Mode
is Independent.

SCENARIO:-
---------

(1)----(2)----(3)----(4)

1) Node 1,2,3 and 4 are Label-Switched-Routers (LSR).
2) Label Distribution Control Mode for each node is Independent.
3) Nodes are connected by point to point links as shown above.

In Independent mode, a node can generate a label mapping immediately,
without obtaining a label bind from next hop. So there is chance that
packets might get dropped due to "bad label" at intermediate hop,
which would not happen if Label Distribution control mode is "Ordered".


APPLICATIONS:-
