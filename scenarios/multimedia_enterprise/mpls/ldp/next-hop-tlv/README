PURPOSE:-
--------
Showing Mpls-Ldp "Loop" detection depending on maximum allowable
hop count. If hop count exceeds maximum allowable hop count then
there is a potential loop.

SCENARIO:-
---------

(1)----(2)----(3)----(4)

1) Node 1,2,3 and 4 are Label-Switched-Routers (LSR).
2) Label Distribution Control Mode for each node is Independent.
3) Nodes are connected by point to point links as shown above.

Application packet is sent from node 1 to node 4 (3 hops). Maximum
allowable hopcount is set to 1. So a loop will be detected and packet
will not reach at node 4

APPLICATIONS:-
-------------

RUN:-
----
Run '<QUALNET_HOME>/bin/qualnet next-hop-tlv.config'.


DESCRIPTION OF THE FILES:-
-------------------------
1. next-hop-tlv.app -  QualNet configuration file for application input.
2. next-hop-tlv.config - QualNet configuration input file.
3. next-hop-tlv.expected.stat - QualNet statistics collection.
4. README - This file.
