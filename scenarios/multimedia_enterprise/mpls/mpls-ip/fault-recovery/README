PURPOSE:-
--------
To show that MPLS based fault recovery occurs after the fault is UP.

SCENARIO:-
---------

(1)----(2)----(3)----(4)- - -(5)----(6)----(7)
          

              

1. Nodes 1 and 7 are Pure IP.
2. Nodes 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 are Label-Switched-Routers (LSR)
3. Fault occurs at link connecting Nodes 4 and 5 from 100S to 130S 
4. Application data flows till 100S. 
5. It again resumes after 130S (when fault recovery occurs)
6. All Nodes are connected by a point-to-point link.


APPLICATIONS:-
