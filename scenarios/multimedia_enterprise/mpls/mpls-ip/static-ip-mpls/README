PURPOSE:-
--------
To show that static routes configurations are supported in MPLS
backbone in an IP-MPLS-IP scenario.

SCENARIO:-
---------

(1)----(2)----(3)----(4)----(5)----(6)
          

              

1. Nodes 1 and 6 are Pure IP.
2. Nodes 2, 3, 4 and 5 are Label-Switched-Routers (LSR)
3. All Nodes are connected by a point-to-point link.
4. The LSP's (2 --> 5 and 5 --> 2) are statically configured


APPLICATIONS:-
-------------
CBR 1 6 100 512 5S 60S 600S PRECEDENCE 0
FTP 1 6 100 60S

RUN:-
----
Run '<QUALNET_HOME>/bin/qualnet static-ip-mpls.config'.


DESCRIPTION OF THE FILES:-
-------------------------
1. static-ip-mpls.app -  QualNet configuration file for application input.
2. static-ip-mpls.config - QualNet configuration input file.
3. static-ip-mpls.expected.stat - QualNet statistics collection.
4. static-ip-mpls.nodes - QualNet configuration file for Nodes placement
5. static-ip-mpls.mpls-routes - QualNet input file for MPLS static routes
6. README - This file.
