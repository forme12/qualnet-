PURPOSE:-
--------
Showing Propagation of Packets from Source Node (Pure IP) to 
destination Node (PureIP) via multiple MPLS backbones.

SCENARIO:-
---------
        +---(2)----(3)----(4)---+         +---(6)----(7)----(8)---+
        |                       |         |                       |

   (1)--+                       +---(5)---+                       +--(9)           
                    
              

1) Nodes 1, 5 and 9 are Pure IP.
2. Nodes 2, 3, 4, 6, 7 and 8 are Label-Switched-Routers (LSR)
2) Nodes 2,3,4 form part of MPLS Backbone 1 
3. Nodes 6,7,8 form part of MPLS Backbone 2
3) All Nodes are connected by a point-to-point link.
