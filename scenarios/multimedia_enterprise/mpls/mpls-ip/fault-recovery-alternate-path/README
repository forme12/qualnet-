PURPOSE:-
--------
To show that the Alternate recovery path is chosen correctly when
there is a fault occurred in the working path and the Alternate path 
is Merged at PML to working path.

1. Nodes 1, and 9 are Pure IP.
2. Nodes 2, 3, 4, 5 , 6 and 8 are Label-Switched-Routers (LSR)
3. Fault occurs at link connecting Nodes 6 and 5 from 100S to 130S 
4. Initial working path is 1-2-6-5-8-9
5. Alternate recovery Path chosen is 1-2-3-4-5-8-9
6. All Nodes are connected by a point-to-point link.
7. Some packets will be lost when fault occurs at link, till the time
   the alternate path is chosen.
