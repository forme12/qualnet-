PURPOSE:-
--------
To show FEC classification based on TOS (priority) of IP traffic
in an IP-MPLS scenario.

SCENARIO:-
---------

          |           |
          |           |

          +----(4)----+

              

1. Nodes 6, and 5 are Pure IP.
2. Nodes 1, 2, 3 and 4 are Label-Switched-Routers (LSR)
3. The LSP's have been statically configured via file.
4. Path is 1-2-3 has been configured for TOS 1
5. Path is 1-4-3 has been configured for TOS 2
6. All Nodes are connected by a point-to-point link.


APPLICATIONS:-
-------------
CBR 6 5 100 512 5S 60S 600S TOS 1
FTP/GENERIC 6 5 100 512 60S 600S TOS 1
CBR 6 5 100 512 5S 60S 600S TOS 2
FTP/GENERIC 6 5 100 512 60S 600S TOS 2


RUN:-
