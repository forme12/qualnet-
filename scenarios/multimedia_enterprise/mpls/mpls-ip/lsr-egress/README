PURPOSE:-
--------
To demonstrate that an LSR can act as both Egress as well as Intermediate
LSR depending on the scenario topology in an IP-MPLS scenario.

SCENARIO:-
---------
                (8)----(7)
                        +
                        |
                        |
                        +
   (1)---(2)----(3)----(4)---(5)
                        +
                        |
                        |
                        +
                       (6)
                        +
                        |
                        |
                        +
                       (9)           
                    
              

1) Nodes 1, 5, 8 and 9 are Pure IP.
2) Nodes 2, 3, 4, 6 and 7 are Label-Switched-Routers (LSR)
3) Node 4 behaves as Egress for the data traffic coming from
   Node 1 destined to node 5, and also behaves as Intermediate
   LSR for data traffic coming from node 9 and destined for node 8.
4) All Nodes are connected by a point-to-point link.
