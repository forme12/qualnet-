PURPOSE:-
--------
To show the operation of MPLS when Label Distribution Style is static.


SCENARIO:-
---------
             
        1-------2-------3            
        
All the nodes are MPLS enabled with static labels configured.


APPLICATIONS:-
-------------
Node 1 is sending CBR packet to Node 2
Node 1 is sending CBR packet to Node 3
Node 2 is sending CBR packet to Node 1
Node 2 is sending CBR packet to Node 3
Node 3 is sending CBR packet to Node 1
Node 3 is sending CBR packet to Node 2


RUN:-
----
Run '<QUALNET_HOME>/bin/qualnet static.config'


DESCRIPTION OF THE FILES:-
-------------------------
1. static.app - QualNet configuration file for application input.
2. static.config - QualNet configuration input file.
3. static.expected.stat - QualNet statistics collection.
4. static.mpls-routes - QualNet input file for MPLS static routes.
5. README - This file.
