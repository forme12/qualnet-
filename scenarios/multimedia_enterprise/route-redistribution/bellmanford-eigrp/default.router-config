# CONFIGURATION FOR ROUTE REDISTRIBUTION
# --------------------------------------
#
# Inputs in this file are case insensitive.

# NODE-IDENTIFIER <node-id>
#  node-id: The node where redistribution is defined.
#
# ROUTER <protocol>
#  protocol: The protocol to which routes should to be redistributed.
#
# REDISTRIBUTE protocol [metric metric-value] [route-map map-tag]
# {<Start Time> <End Time>}
#
# NO REDISTRIBUTE protocol [metric metric-value] [route-map map-tag]
# {<Start Time> <End Time>}

#   protocol: Routes found by this protocol will be redistributed into
#   other protocols specified by the 'ROUTER' command.
#
#
#   metric-value: This is the value associated with each route represents
#   the cost to reach the destination. In case of IGRP this is represented
#   by 5 quantities. Viz. bandwidth, reliability, delay, load, MTU
#
#
#   map-tag: Route map that should be interrogated to filter the
#   importation of routes from this source routing protocol to the current
#   routing protocol. If not specified, all routes are redistributed. If
#   this keyword is specified, but no route map tags are listed,
#   no routes will be imported.
#
#   Start Time: Route redistribution will start at the said start time.
#
#   End Time: Route redistribution will end at the said end time.

#   N.B.:- 'NO REDISTRIBUTE' command has the higher priority than the
#   'REDISTRIBUTE' command. If both the commands were specified for a same
#   router then routes would not be redistributed provided the start time
#   and end time are same for both.
