PURPOSE:-
--------
To Test the BGP implementation in ASes which run IGP with IPv6 protocol.



SCENARIO:-
---------
In this scenario, BGP is running between the 3 different AS. (AS-4000, AS-5000, AS-10000 )
where:
AS-4000={1 through 5},AS-5000 = {9 thru 13}, AS-1000 = {6 thru 8} 
AS 4000 and AS 5000 are configured to be running 802.3 as MAC-Protocol 
AS 10000 has point-to-point wired link topology configuration 

AS 4000,5000, and 1000 are running OSPFv3.



RUN:-
----
Run '<QUALNET_HOME>/bin/qualnet igp-mix-v6.config'.


DESCRIPTION OF THE FILES:-
-------------------------
1.igp-mix-v6-.bgp-The file contains BGP configuration(iBGP and eBGP) 
2. igp-mix-v6.app -  QualNet configuration file for application input.
3. igp-mix-v6.config - QualNet configuration input file.
