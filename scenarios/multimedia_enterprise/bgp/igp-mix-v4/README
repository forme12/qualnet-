PURPOSE:-
--------
To Test the BGP implementation in a mixed igp network scenario.



SCENARIO:-
---------
In this scenario, BGP is running between the 3 different AS. (AS-4000, AS-5000, AS-10000 )
where:
AS-4000={1 through 5},AS-5000 = {9 thru 13}, AS-1000 = {6 thru 8} 
AS 4000 is configured to be running 802.3 as MAC-Protocol 
AS 5000 is a wireless subnet which runs 802.11b as MAC-Protocol 

AS 4000 is running IGRP.
AS 10000 is running OSPFv2
AS 5000 is running EIGRP.


RUN:-
----
Run '<QUALNET_HOME>/bin/qualnet igp-mix-v4.config'.


DESCRIPTION OF THE FILES:-
-------------------------
1.igp-mix-v4-.bgp-The file contains BGP configuration(iBGP and eBGP) 
2. igp-mix-v4.app -  QualNet configuration file for application input.
3. igp-mix-v4.config - QualNet configuration input file.
3. igp-mix-v4.nodes - QualNet node placement file for the simulation run.
4. igp-mix-v4.expected.stat - QualNet statistics collection.
5. README - This file.
