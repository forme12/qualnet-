PURPOSE:-
-------
Testing reservation style FF (Shared Explicit) with no explicit route.

SCENARIO:-
---------

   (1)         (6)----(7)         (9)
     \       /            \      /
       \   /                \  /
        (3)----(4)----(5)----(8)
       /                       \
     /                           \
   (2)                           (10)

The reservation style is FF
There is an explicit routing through the node 1 3 4 5 8 9.
Record Route is set NORMAL, path will be recorded

Initially the LSP is established based on the routing protocol. The path is
located along the nodes 1 3 6 7 8 9. The first CBR application starts at 30S.
So it sends the data packets through this established path through 1 3 6 7 8
and 9.

After the adjacency is formed through the hello extension, the explicit path
defined in default.config is considered as the LSP path. Before initiating
the explicit route path processing, a path tear message is sent from the
sender to tear down the original path. This message is propagated from
source to destination to tear the path. After then the RSVP messaging is
started again to create the explicit path along 1 3 4 5 8 9. The second
application starts at 20M. At that time explicit route path is formed and
the data packets are sent through this path.

The TestResult file shows the PSBs and RSBs at the end of the simulation. So
it shows only the explicit routed path.

OTHER INPUTS:-
-------------
CBR applications sending packets from
        node 1 to node 9,
        node 1 to node 9

BELLMANFORD routing protocol is used.
