PURPOSE:-
--------
Test RSVP-TE operation with Record route NORMAL and
reservation style FF. In addition to that an explicit route is set
such that a loop will be detected at node 3.

SCENARIO:-
---------

                   (5)
                    | \
                    |   \

                    |
                   (7)

Explicit path from node 1 to node 7 is set as 1->2->3->4->5->3->6->7.
A loop will be detected at node 3.

OTHER INPUTS:-
-------------
CBR applications sending packets from
    node 1 to node 7,

BELLMANFORD routing protocol is used.


RUN:-
---
Run '<QUALNET_HOME>/bin/qualnet default.config'.
