PURPOSE:-
--------
To show the operation of PIM-SM protocol in a string topology network.



SCENARIO:-
---------
In this scenario, there is one MCBR session, with node 1 being the multicast
source, 3 RP, and nodes 6, 7, 8, 10 and 11 being the multicast receivers.  
Nodes 4, 5 and 9 are the IGMP router.
The link capacity is 10Mbps for all links.

                      6 R

              \      / 
               ---- 9 
                     \
                      11 R

MCBR is used to transfer 240 data segments of 512B each at 5 second intervals
starting at 6 minutes into the simulation. Receivers 6 and 7 join group at 
5 minutes into simulation.

Receivers 10 and 11  also join at 5M into simulation, but leave group at 10M and 
20M leading to pruning of upstream of node 9

RUN:-
----

Run '<QUALNET_HOME>/bin/qualnet tree-prune-sm.config'.
