PURPOSE:-
--------
To show the operation of PIM-SM protocol in a tree topology network where some receivers 
join in middle of the simulation across multi-access LAN segment.



SCENARIO:-
---------
In this scenario, there is one MCBR session, with node 1 being the multicast
source, 5 RP, and nodes 4, 9 and 10 being multicast receiver.  Nodes 3, 6, 7 and 8 are the IGMP routers.
The link capacity is 10Mbps for all links.

                       |


MCBR is used to transfer 240 data segments of 512B each at 5 second intervals
starting at 6 minutes into the simulation.

Receivers 9 join at 15 minute, and 10 join at 20 minutes into the simulation.
Receiver 4 joins at 5M and remains joined for rest of the simulation duration.



RUN:-
----

Run '<QUALNET_HOME>/bin/qualnet multiaccessLAN-join-sm.config'.
