PURPOSE:-
--------
To show the operation of PIM-SM protocol in a string topology network.



SCENARIO:-
---------
In this scenario, there is one MCBR session, with node 1 being the multicast
source, 2 RP, and nodes 6, 7 being the multicast receivers.  Node 5 is the IGMP router.
The link capacity is 10Mbps for all links.

                       \
                        7 R


MCBR is used to transfer 240 data segments of 512B each at 5 second intervals
starting at 6 minutes into the simulation.


Receivers 6 and 7 join group at 5 minutes into simulation
