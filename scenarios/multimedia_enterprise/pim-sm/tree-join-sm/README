PURPOSE:-
--------
To show the operation of PIM-SM protocol in a tree topology network where some receivers 
join in middle of the simulation.



SCENARIO:-
---------
In this scenario, there is one MCBR session, with node 1 being the multicast
source, 4 RP, and nodes 6 and 7 being multicast receiver.  Nodes 3 and 5 are the IGMP routers.
The link capacity is 10Mbps for all links.


         2 R          6 R
         |           /
    |    |          /
    |----3----4----5
1 --|         RP    \
                     \
                      7 R


MCBR is used to transfer 240 data segments of 512B each at 5 second intervals
starting at 6 minutes into the simulation.

Receivers 6 join at 16 minute, and 7 join at 21 minute of the simulation.
Receiver 2 joins at 5 minute and remains joined for rest of the simulation duration.



RUN:-
----

Run '<QUALNET_HOME>/bin/qualnet tree-join-sm.config'.
