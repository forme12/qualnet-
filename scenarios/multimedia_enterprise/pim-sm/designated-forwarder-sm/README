PURPOSE:-
--------
To show the selection of designated router in PIM-SM protocol in a multi-access LAN topology.



SCENARIO:-
---------
In this scenario, there is one MCBR session, with node 1 being the multicast
source and node 6 being the multicast receiver.  Nodes 3, 4 and 5 are the IGMP routers connecting 
to receiver 6 over multi-access LAN. The link capacity is 10Mbps for all links.
