PURPOSE:-
--------
One of the intermediate multicast router goes down and then comes back up while its downstream 
remains on multicast group


SCENARIO:-
---------
In this scenario, there is one MCBR session, with node 1 being the multicast
source and nodes 5,7,9,15 and 18 being the multicast receivers.
Nodes 4,8,12,16 and 20 are the IGMP routers. The link capacity is 10 Mbps for all links.

The link between 8 - 21, 8 - 12, and 8 - 20 is down from 13M to 18M into simulation.

This is done by following fault creations:

INTERFACE-FAULT 192.0.9.1 13M 18M
INTERFACE-FAULT 192.0.6.1 13M 18M
INTERFACE-FAULT 192.0.10.1 13M 18M                  S

starting at 5 minutes into the simulation.
