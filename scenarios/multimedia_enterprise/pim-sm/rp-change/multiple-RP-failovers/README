PURPOSE:-
--------
To show the RP change mechanism in sparse mode when multiple candidate RPs are configured 
and RP failure occurs in quick succession among them in PIM sparse mode protocol in a 
multiaccess LAN topology.



SCENARIO:-
---------
In this scenario, there is one MCBR session, with node 1 being the multicast source and node 38 
being the multicast receiver.  Node 19 is the IGMP router connecting to receiver 38. The link 
capacity is 10Mbps for all links. Multicast protocol PIM  with sparse mode is enabled on nodes 
2 to 37. Nodes 2 to 18 are candidate RPs with different RP priorities set. 
Individual Interface-faults for interface from nodes 20 to 37 with subnet is introduced with a 
period of 5M each in a random manner.

MCBR is used to transfer 10000 items of 512B each at 20 second intervals starting at 3 minutes into the 
simulation.
