PURPOSE:-
--------
To show the SPT switchover mechanism when mixed path is available: one hop path and multiple hop 
path, in PIM-SM protocol in a multiple multiaccess LAN topology.

 

SCENARIO:-
---------
In this scenario, there is 1 MCBR session with node 1 being the multicast source and node 15 
being the multicast receiver.  Nodes 14 and 24 are the IGMP routers connecting to receiver 15. The 
link capacity is 10Mbps for all links. 
Multicast protocol PIM  with sparse mode is enabled on nodes 1 to 26. Node 24 is RP. 
Interface fault is introduced in node 15 interface so as it is initially cut from SPT path.

One MCBR is used to transfer 10000 items of 512B each at 10 second intervals starting at 10 minutes and 
into the simulation.
