PURPOSE:-
--------
To show the SPT switchover mechanism when multiple applications are configured on different 
interfaces of a node in PIM-SM protocol in multi-access LAN topology.



SCENARIO:-
---------
In this scenario, there are 2 MCBR sessions, with each interface of node 1 being the multicast 
source and nodes 11, 12, 13 and 14 being the multicast receivers.  Nodes 9 and 10 are the IGMP 
routers connecting to receivers 13 and 14, and 11 and 12, respectively. The link capacity is 
10Mbps for all links. 
Multicast protocol PIM  with sparse mode is enabled on nodes 1 to 10. Node 4 is RP. 
Interface fault is introduced in nodes 4 and nodes 6 interfaces to cause repeated RP failure.

One MCBR is used to transfer 512B each at 5 second intervals starting at 10 minutes into the 
simulation and other MCBR is used to transfer 512B each at 2.5 second intervals tarting at 10 
minutes into the simulation.
