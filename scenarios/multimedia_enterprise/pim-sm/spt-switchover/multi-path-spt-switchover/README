PURPOSE:-
--------
To show the SPT switchover mechanism when multiple shortest paths are available and there are subsequent 
faults in paths in PIM-SM protocol in multi-access LAN topology.


 

SCENARIO:-
---------
In this scenario, there is 1 MCBR session with node 1 being the multicast source and node  7 
being the multicast receivers.  Node 6 is the IGMP router connecting to receiver 7. The link capacity is 
10Mbps for all links. 
Multicast protocol PIM  with sparse mode is enabled on nodes 2 to 6, 8 and 9. Node 3 is RP. 
Interface fault is introduced in different paths from node 2 to 6 so as to cause SPT switch to a path.
