PURPOSE:-
--------
To show the operation of ospf over wireless network in
Point-to-Multipoint mode.


SCENARIO:-
---------
In this scenario we have two subnets each having 6 nodes. The nodes
are placed in such a way that all nodes of a subnet are on a circle
with chord length between two adjacent node being 250m. With proper setting
of PHY802.11b-TX-POWER we make only adjacent nodes to be directly reachable.

There are two CBR sessions, with node 1 and node 12 being the sources
and node 10 and node 3 being the corresponding destinations. Sources and
destinations belong to different subnets.

CBR is used to transfer 10 data segments of 512B each at 5 second intervals
starting at 70 minutes into the simulation.
