PURPOSE:-
--------
To show the working of demand circuit if one area
contains all DC capable routers and another area contains a router
which is not demand circuit capable i.e to generate indication LSA


SCENARIO:-
---------
In this scenario, we have two areas.One contains a LINK as demand circuit 
and in that area all routers support demand circuit and second area contains 
a router not supporting demand circuit.

CBR is used to transfer 600 data segments of 512B each at 5 second intervals
starting at 20 minutes to 30 minutes.

DEMAND CIRCUIT CONFIGURATIONS:-
-------------------------------
Area 1: all routers support DC.
Area 0: all routers support DC except node 8.
LINK (1, 2) is a DC.


RUN:-
----

Run '<QUALNET_HOME>/bin/qualnet area1-DC-area2-notDC.config'.
