PURPOSE:-
--------
To show the working of demand circuit if all routers support
demand circuit and more than one area is present in the scenario.


SCENARIO:-
---------
In this scenario, two areas are present.One contains a LINK as demand circuit 
and in that area all routers support demand circuit and same for second 
area but it does not contain any demand circuit link.

CBR is used to transfer 600 data segments of 512B each at 5 second intervals
starting at 20 minutes to 30 minutes.

DEMAND CIRCUIT CONFIGURATIONS:-
-------------------------------
Area 0: all routers support DC.
Area 1: all routers support DC.
LINK (1, 2) is a DC.


RUN:-
----

Run '<QUALNET_HOME>/bin/qualnet area1-DC-area2-DC.config'.
