PURPOSE:-
--------
To show the operation of ospfv2 in a two-node network.



SCENARIO:-
---------
In this scenario, there is one CBR session, with node 1 being the source
and node 2 being the destination.  The link capacity between node 1 and
node 2 is 2Mbps.


1 ------- 2
   2Mbps

CBR is used to transfer 10 data segments of 512B each at 5 second intervals
starting at 70 minutes into the simulation.



RUN:-
----

Run '<QUALNET_HOME>/bin/qualnet ospfv2-normal-2node.config'.


DESCRIPTION OF THE FILES:-
-------------------------
1. ospfv2-normal-2node.app -  QualNet application configuration file
2. ospfv2-normal-2node.config - QualNet configuration input file.
3. qualnet.stat - QualNet statistics collection for CBR and OSPFv2.
4. README - This file.
