PURPOSE:-
--------
To show the operation of OSPFv2 in a disjoint network.



SCENARIO:-
---------
In this scenario, there is one CBR session, with node 1 being the source
and node 4 being the destination.  All links are 2Mbps in capacity.

1 ------- 2         3 ------- 4
   2Mbps               2Mbps

CBR is used to transfer 10 data segments of 512B each at 5 second intervals
starting at 70 minutes into the simulation.
No packets are delivered since node 1 and node 4 are in disjoint networks.



RUN:-
----

Type '<QUALNET_HOME>/bin/qualnet ospfv2-disjoint.config'.



DESCRIPTION OF THE FILES:-
-------------------------
1. ospfv2-disjoint.app -  QualNet application configuration file
2. ospfv2-disjoint.config - QualNet configuration input file.
3. ospfv2-disjoint.expected.stat - QualNet statistics collection for
                                   CBR and OSPFv2.
