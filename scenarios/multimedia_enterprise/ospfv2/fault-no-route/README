PURPOSE:-
--------
To show the operation of ospfv2 in a four-node network when there's
a link fault between node 1 and node 2.


SCENARIO:-
---------
In this scenario, there is one CBR session, with node 1 being the source
and node 3 being the destination.  All links are 2Mbps in capacity.
The link between node 1 and node 2 is down for the entire simulation.

CBR is used to transfer 10 data segments of 512B each at 5 second intervals
starting at 70 minutes into the simulation.
No data traffic will be routed to node 3.
