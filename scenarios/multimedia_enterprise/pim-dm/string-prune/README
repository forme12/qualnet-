PURPOSE:-
--------
To show the prune operation of PIM-DM in a string topology network.
The multicast receiver will not receive all data sent by the source
since the receiver leaves the group early, causing a prune.



SCENARIO:-
---------
In this scenario, there is one MCBR session, with node 1 being the multicast
source and node 5 being the multicast receiver.  Node 5 joins the group
1 minute into the simulation and leaves at 12 minutes into the simulation.
Node 4 is the IGMP router.
The link capacity is 10 Mbps for all links.


1 ------- 2 ------- 3 ------- 4 ------- 5


MCBR is used to transfer 240 data segments of 512B each at 5 second intervals
starting at 10 minutes into the simulation.



RUN:-
----

Run '<QUALNET_HOME>/bin/qualnet string-prune.config'.


DESCRIPTION OF THE FILES:-
-------------------------
1. string-prune.app -  QualNet application configuration input file
2. string-prune.config - QualNet configuration input file.
3. string-prune.member - Specifies the multicast group.
4. string-prune.expected.stat - QualNet statistics collection for MCBR and PIM-DM.
5. README - This file.
