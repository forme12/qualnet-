This document describes the sample scenarios for the mac switched model.
These scenarios aim to illustrate some functional aspects of the model
as well as configuration requirements.

Salient features of the configuration are described here. Each scenario
has more details within the 'default.config' file in the respective
sub-directories.

Performance
    Reduction of bus conflicts,
    Increase of available bandwidth,
    Reduction of run time.


There are two scenarios for comparison.

In the first, there are a total of 32 nodes attached in groups of 8 nodes
per 802.3 LAN segment to different ports of a switch.

The second scenario has each of the 32 nodes attached to individual ports
of a switch. Here, each of the nodes have the full bandwidth of the LAN
available to them.

Spanning tree
    Creation of loop free single spanning tree,
    Determination of new spanning tree after topology change.


The first scenario illustrates a scenario with loops. There are
additional commented user configuration to allow root preference,
change path costs (port costs), alter timer values.

The second scenario uses the same topology and introduces interface
faults at various interfaces of the switches. This results in
recomputation to different spanning trees.

VLANs
    Isolation of broadcast domains,
    Intra-VLAN and inter-VLAN communication.


The first scenario illustrates the VLAN related configuration for
VLAN member sets, untagged sets, port VLAN ID at the switch and
switch ports.

The second scenario considers a configuration where multicasts groups
span more than one VLAN in a switched scenario.

GVRP/GARP
    Dynamic configuration of member sets,
    Operation with STP in larger networks.


The first scenario matches the one under vlan/sample1 with the
difference that GVRP is enabled to dynamically create the member
sets instead of them having to be manually input in the .config
file.

The second scenario takes the popular 'ring of 8' scenario
to illustrate the operations of GVRP in parallel with STP.
