PURPOSE:-

To configure and test the functionality of GVRP.


SCENARIO:-

This scenario matches the one under vlan/sample1. The
principle difference is in that GVRP is enabled. As a
consequence, the required manual configuration of member
sets at each switch is eliminated as this is dynamically
created by the operation of GVRP in association with the
GARP applicant/registrar state machine.
