PURPOSE:-

To configure and test the functionality of GVRP.


SCENARIO:-

The 'ring of 8' scenario illustrates the operations of GVRP
in parallel with STP. GVRP propagation waits till STP has
stabilized and ports have moved to forwarding state.

In particular, it illustrate how GVRP eases the error-prone
configuration of member sets of large switched networks. Here,
it suffices to configure the port VLAN IDs of the port connected
to the access links, e.g. Switch 1 needs only have one port
set to a PVID of 2.
