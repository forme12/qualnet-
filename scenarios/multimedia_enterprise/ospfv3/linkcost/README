PURPOSE:-
--------
To show:
OSPFv3 implementation in a simple IPv6 network for the link cost.


SCENARIO:-
---------
In this scenario:
All Nodes 1 thru 5 are in a Single Area with Link costs specified as shown
in the below network topology.


        [Cost = 10]             [Cost = 10]     
         +----------(2)----------+
         |                       |
         |                       |
         |                       |
        (1)                      +-------------(3)
         |                                      |
         |                                      |
         |                                      |
         +--------(4)-----------(5)-------------+
        [Cost = 2]    [Cost = 3]     [Cost = 4]
                
        
        
  

APPLICATIONS:-
------------
CBR 1 3 0 512 1S 300S 0S PRECEDENCE 0
FTP/GENERIC 3 1 1000 512 300S 0S PRECEDENCE 0

CBR is used to transfer continuous data segments of 512 bytes each at
1 second interval, starting from 300 seconds till the end of the 
simulation between Node-1 to Node-3.

Node-3 initiates an FTP/GENERIC session with Node-1.
  
  
 
RUN:-
----
