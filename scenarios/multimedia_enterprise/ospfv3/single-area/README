APPLICATIONS:-
------------
CBR 4 2 0 512 1S 300S 0S PRECEDENCE 0
CBR 1 6 0 512 1S 300S 0S PRECEDENCE 0
  
CBR is used to transfer continuous data segments of 512 bytes each at
1 second interval, starting from 300 seconds till the end of the 
simulation between Node-4 to Node-2 and Node-1 to Node-6.
