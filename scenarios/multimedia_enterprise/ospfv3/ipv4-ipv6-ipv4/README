PURPOSE:-
--------
To show:
The behavior of OSPFv3 implementation in a simple IPv4-IPv6 mixed protocol network.


SCENARIO:-
---------
In this scenario:
Nodes 1 thru 3, and Nodes 5 thru 7 form an IPv4 network with Bellmanford
as the routing protocol. Nodes 3 thru 5 form an IPv6 network with OSPFv3
as the routing protocol. End to End destined IPv4 packets use the IPv6 
tunnel between the IPv4/IPv6 Nodes 3 and 5 as shown in the below network
topology.

APPLICATIONS:-
------------
CBR 1 7 0 512 1S 300S 0S PRECEDENCE 0
FTP/GENERIC 6 1 1000 512 300S 0S PRECEDENCE 0
CBR 6 2 0 512 1S 300S 0S PRECEDENCE 0

CBR is used to transfer continuous data segments of 512 bytes each at
1 second interval, starting from 300 seconds till the end of the 
simulation between Node-1 to Node-7 and Node-6 to Node-2.

Node-6 initiates an FTP/GENERIC session with Node-2.
