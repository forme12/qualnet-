PURPOSE:-
--------
To show:
OSPFv3 implementation in a simple IPv6 adhoc multiple hops wireless network.


SCENARIO:-
---------
In this scenario: 
Nodes 1 thru 5 are placed such that each node is within the range of the adjacent
nodes to form an adhoc multihop network as shown in the below network topology.

        
        
        (1)             (2)             (3)             (4)             (5)
        
                                                                              
                                                                              
        
APPLICATIONS:-
------------
CBR 1 5 0 512 1S 300S 0S PRECEDENCE 0
CBR 5 1 0 512 1S 300S 0S PRECEDENCE 0

CBR is used to transfer continuous data segments of 512 bytes each at
1 second interval, starting from 300 seconds till the end of the 
simulation between Node-1 to Node-5 and Node-5 to Node-1.
