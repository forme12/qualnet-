PURPOSE:-
--------
To show:
The behavior of OSPFv3 implementation in a simple IPv6 wireless network.


SCENARIO:-
---------
In this scenario: 
Area-1 contains a Wireless subnet with Nodes 1 thru 3. Area-0 contains Nodes 3 thru 5 
connected using Wireless links. Area-2 contains Wireless subnet with Nodes 5 thru 8 
as shown in the below network topology.

        
        
<<   Area-1  -->>|<<-----       Area-0         ---->>|<<--  Area-2   -->>

                 |                                   |
         (1)                                             (6)
                 |                                   |
         
         ...    (3)...............(4)...............(5)  ...  (7)
         
                 |                                   |
         (2)                                             (8)
                 |                                   |
         
                 |                                   |
         
 

         

APPLICATIONS:-
------------
CBR 1 6 0 512 1S 300S 0S PRECEDENCE 0
FTP/GENERIC 7 1 10000 512 300S 0S PRECEDENCE 0

CBR is used to transfer continuous data segments of 512 bytes each at
1 second interval, starting from 300 seconds till the end of the 
simulation between Node-1 to Node-6.

Node-7 initiates an FTP/GENERIC session with Node-1.
  

RUN:-
----
Run '<QUALNET_HOME>/bin/qualnet wireless.config'
