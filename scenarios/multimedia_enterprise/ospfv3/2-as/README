PURPOSE:-
--------
To show:
OSPFv3 interaction with the external AS, AS External LSA origination 
along with other OSPF packets.


SCENARIO:-
---------
In this scenario: 
AS-1 contains Node-1 thru Node-3, and Node-6 within the respective areas.
Node-4 and Node-5 within AS-2, use default and static routes for 
communication. The external routes of AS-2 are injected into the OSPFv3 
network on Node-3 as shown in the below network topology.

APPLICATIONS:-
------------
CBR 6 5 0 512 1S 300S 0S PRECEDENCE 0
FTP/GENERIC 5 1 1000 512 300S 0S PRECEDENCE 0
CBR 4 6 0 512 1S 300S 0S PRECEDENCE 0
  
CBR is used to transfer continuous data segments of 512 bytes each at
1 second interval, starting from 300 seconds till the end of the 
simulation between Node-6 to Node-5 and Node-4 to Node-6.

Node-5 initiates an FTP/GENERIC session with Node-1.
