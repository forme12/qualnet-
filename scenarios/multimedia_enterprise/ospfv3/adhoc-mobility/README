PURPOSE:-
--------
To show:
OSPFv3 implementation in a simple IPv6 adhoc multiple hops wireless network
configured with mobility.

SCENARIO:-
---------
In this scenario: 
Nodes 1 thru 5 are placed such that each node is within the range of the adjacent
nodes to form an adhoc multihop network. Node-1 and Node-5 are configured with 
mobility as shown in the below network topology.
        

                        ..>(1)>..   >>  ..>(1)>..   >>  ..>(1)>..       
                    .                                                   .        
                  .                                                        .            
                                                                             .          
                [(1)]           [(2)]           [(3)]           [(4)]           [(5)]
        [Node-5 Final Position]                                         [Node-1 Final Position]              .        
                 .                                                          .
                    .                                                  .              
                        ..<(5)<..   <<  ..<(5)<..   <<  ..<(5)<..
         
                 
                 

APPLICATIONS:-
------------
CBR 1 5 0 512 1S 300S 0S PRECEDENCE 0
CBR 5 1 0 512 1S 300S 0S PRECEDENCE 0

CBR is used to transfer continuous data segments of 512 bytes each at
1 second interval, starting from 300 seconds till the end of the 
simulation between Node-1 to Node-5 and Node-5 to Node-1.
