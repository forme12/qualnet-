PURPOSE:-
--------
To show:
OSPFv3 implementation configured with multiple areas and Origination 
of OSPF packets.


SCENARIO:-
---------
In this scenario:
Area-1 contains Nodes 1 thru 3 connected with a Hub. Area-2 contains Nodes 6 thru 8, 12.
Area-3 contains Nodes 4 and 10. Area-4 contains Nodes 5 and 11. Area-0/Backbone area
contains Nodes 3 thru 6 as shown in the below network topology.

APPLICATIONS:-
------------
CBR 1 12 0 512 1S 300S 0S PRECEDENCE 0
FTP/GENERIC 10 11 1000 512 300S 0S PRECEDENCE 0
CBR 2 8 0 512 1S 300S 0S PRECEDENCE 0

CBR is used to transfer continuous data segments of 512 bytes each at
1 second interval, starting from 300 seconds till the end of the 
simulation between Node-1 to Node-12 and Node-2 to Node-8.

Node-10 initiates an FTP/GENERIC session with Node-11.
