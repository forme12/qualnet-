PURPOSE:-
--------
To show:
OSPFv3 implementation in a simple IPv6 network, for DR-BDR election and LS Aging.


SCENARIO:-
---------
In this scenario: 
Nodes 1 thru 5 are connected with a Switch. Nodes 5, 7, 10 and 18 are
connected with another Switch. Nodes 6 thru 9 are connected with a Hub. 
Nodes 10 thru 12, 15 form a Wireless subnet. Nodes 10, 14 thru 17 form 
another wireless subnet. The multiple broadcast network formed by these
nodes are within a Single Area and is as shown in the below network 
topology.

Note:   Node-10 and Node-15 are connected to both wireless subnets.
  

APPLICATIONS:-
------------
CBR 2 16 0 512 1S 300S 0S PRECEDENCE 0
CBR 6 12 0 512 1S 300S 0S PRECEDENCE 0
CBR 8 2 0 512 1S 300S 0S PRECEDENCE 0
FTP/GENERIC 1 17 1000 512 300S 0S PRECEDENCE 0
CBR 4 15 0 512 1S 300S 0S PRECEDENCE 0

  
CBR is used to transfer continuous data segments of 512 bytes each at
1 second interval, starting from 300 seconds till the end of the 
simulation between Node-2 to Node-16, Node-6 to Node-12, Node-8 to Node-2,
and Node-4 to Node-15.

Node-1 initiates an FTP/GENERIC session with Node-17.
