Home Automation(Monitoring and Control) with ZigBee Devices: Scenario Description
---------------------------------------------

ZigBee allows small, low-cost devices to quickly transmit small amounts of data such as temperature readings for thermostats, on/off requests for light switches, or keystrokes for a wireless keyboard. 
The scenario showsan application of ZigBee technology for Home Automation. It demonstrates the monitoring and control capability that can be achieved with  ZigBee.

Node types in this scenario are:
RFD sensors (nodes 2 thru 12 )for the following Monitoring and Control purposes:
Motion detection,Scecurity/Alarm,Lighting Control, Window control,Automatic Control, Door Control, Temprature Control, and Environmental Monitoring   

FFD/PAN Coordinator(node 1) for providing connectivity between sensor and control devices.It forms a star wireless network topology using RFD devices
