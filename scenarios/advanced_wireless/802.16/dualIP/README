PURPOSE:-
--------
To test the functionality of IEEE 802.16
when ruining with Dual IP.


SCENARIO:-
---------
There are two 802.16 networks
SLA0 contains 3 nodes, node 1 is BS and rests are SS
SLA1 contains 3 nodes, node 7 is BS and rests are SS
node 1 connects node 4 via wired point-to-point link.
node 4 connects node 5 via wired point-to-point link.
node 5 connects node 6 via wired point-to-point link.
node 6 connects node 7 via wired point-to-point link.
All the nodes except node 5 support IPv6
nodes 4 5 6 support Ipv4 as well. 
Thus, node 4 and node 6 are dual IP nodes.

RIPng and AODV is used in the IPv6 and IPv4 domains respectively.

     (BS)  (dual Ip)      (dual Ip)   (BS)
       1-------4-------5-------6------7
       
    2   3                           8   9
    

Two CBR flows are running:One from node 2 to node 8
one from node 9 to node 3.
- CBR 2 8 100 512 1S 1S 0S PRECEDENCE 0
- CBR 9 3 100 512 1S 1S 0S PRECEDENCE 0

Packets of both flows arrive to destinations successfully. 

RUN:-
----
Run '<QUALNET_HOME>/bin/qualnet dualIP.config'.



DESCRIPTION OF THE FILES:-
-------------------------
1. dualIP.app -  QualNet configuration file for application input.
2. dualIP.config - QualNet configuration input file.
3. dualIP.nodes - QualNet node placement file for the simulation run.
4. dualIP.tunnel - QualNet Dual IP tunnel file
5. dualIP.expected.stat - QualNet statistics collection.
6. README - This file.
