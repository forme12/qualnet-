PURPOSE:-
--------
To test the multiple rates capability of 802.16 using different coding
and modulation combinations. The rates are properly chosen
based on signal strengths. In this sample, the signal strength is mainly
decided by the distance between the BS and SS.

QualNet 802.16 Model only supports 7 coding and modulation combinations.


SCENARIO:-
---------
Seven subnets are created each containing 1 BS and 1 SS. The distances
between the BS and the SS of the seven subnets are adjusted in such a way
that each pair of BS and SS will use a different coding + modulation
combination. Each BS has one CBR flow to the SS in its subnet. The CBR
client generates enough traffic more than the highest data rates. Then
we can observe the different throughputs at the CBR servers due to choices
of different coding + modulation combinations.

Seven CBR flows are defined from BSs to SSs.
