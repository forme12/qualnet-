PURPOSE:-
--------
To test the basic functionality of a 802.16 network when packets are fragmented
at network layer


SCENARIO:-
---------
Only 1 subnet 192.0.0.0 in this scenario. It has 5 nodes. Node 1 is
configured as the base station (BS). Rest nodes are subscriber
stations (SS).

          1 (BS)
   2                5
              4
       3

A TRAFFIC_TRACE flow is from node 2 to node 5.

RUN:-
----
Run '<QUALNET_HOME>/bin/qualnet single-cell-ip-fragmentation.config'.
