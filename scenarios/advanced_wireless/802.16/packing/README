PURPOSE:-
-------
To Test the Packing functionality for 802.16 network.

SCENARIO:-
--------
One subnet is present in the scenario, having one base station (BS) and two
subscriber stations (SS). Nodes 2 and 3 are SS. Node 1 is BS.

TOPOLOGY:
---------


             ------1(BS)----
            |               |
            |               |
            2               3

CBR flow is:

- CBR 2 3 0 40 10US 15S 0S PRECEDENCE 0



There are two cofig files in the scenario one with packing enabled and other
with packing disabled.

Throughput at server is increased significantly when packing is enabled.


RUN:-
----
Run '<QUALNET_HOME>/bin/qualnet Packing-Enable.config'.
Run '<QUALNET_HOME>/bin/qualnet Packing-Disable.config'.



DESCRIPTION OF THE FILES:-
------------------------
1.Packing-Enable.config - QualNet configuration input file(with packing enabled).
2.Packing-Disable.config - QualNet configuration input file(with packing disabled).
3.Packing.app    - QualNet configuration file for application input.
4.Packing.nodes  - QualNet node placement file for the simulation run.
5.Packing-Enable.expected.stat - QualNet statistics collection (with packing enabled).
6.Packing-Disable.expected.stat - QualNet statistics collection(with packing disabled).
