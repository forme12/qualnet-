PURPOSE:-
-------
To test the sleep mode functionality for 802.16 wireless network.

SCENARIO:-
--------
One subnet is present in the scenario, having one base station (BS) and two
subscriber stations (SS). Sleep mode is enabled for node 2.

TOPOLOGY:
--------

            2       1           3
                   (BS)


Energy consumed in transmit and receive mode is less at node 2
as compared to node 3. Also Residual battery is more at node 2.

Node 2 is in sleep mode for 74.3% whereas, Node 3 is in sleep mode for 46.9%.
Node 3 goes to sleep mode when there is no data to transmit during uplink duration.


RUN:-
----
Run '<QUALNET_HOME>/bin/qualnet SleepMode.config'.


DESCRIPTION OF THE FILES:-
------------------------
1.SleepMode.config - QualNet configuration input file.
2.SleepMode.app    - QualNet configuration file for application input.
3.SleepMode.nodes  - QualNet node placement file for the simulation run.
4.SleepMode.expected.stat - QualNet statistics collection.
5.README - This file.
