PURPOSE:-
-------
To test the ARQ functionality for 802.16 network.

SCENARIO:-
---------
One subnet is present in the scenario, having one base station (BS) and two
subscriber stations (SS). Nodes 2 and 3 are SS. Node 1 is BS.

TOPOLOGY:
---------


             ------1(BS)----                          
            |               |

CBR flow is:

- CBR 3 2 100 512 10MS 20S 0S PRECEDENCE 0

Rayleigh Fading model is being used in the scenario.

There are two config files one with ARQ Enabled and the other with ARQ disabled.



A significant change can be noticed in presence of fading when ARQ is Enabled. 
Less packets could reach the server if ARQ is disabled while in
case ARQ is enabled more data packets reaches successfully at the server.

RUN:-
----
Run '<QUALNET_HOME>/bin/qualnet ARQ-Enabled.config'.
Run '<QUALNET_HOME>/bin/qualnet ARQ-Disabled.config'.



DESCRIPTION OF THE FILES:-
------------------------
1.ARQ-Enabled.config - QualNet configuration input file with ARQ Enabled.
2.ARQ-Disabled.config - QualNet configuration input file with ARQ Disabled.
3.ARQ.app    - QualNet configuration file for application input.
4.ARQ.nodes  - QualNet node placement file for the simulation run.
5.ARQ-Enabled.expected.stat - QualNet statistics collection.
6.ARQ-Disabled.expected.stat - QualNet statistics collection.
7.default.fading - Fading File
8.README - This file
