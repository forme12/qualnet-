PURPOSE:-
--------
To test the functionality of IEEE 802.16
when running IPv6 routing protocols.


SCENARIO:-
---------
There are three 802.16 networks
SLA0 contains 3 nodes, node 9 is BS and rests are SS
SLA1 contains 4 nodes, node 1 is BS and rests are SS
SLA2 contains 4 nodes, node 5 is BS and rests are SS
node 1 connects node 9 via wired link.
node 1 connects node 5 via wired link.
All the nodes support IPv6

RIPng/OSPFv3 is used as routing protocol.

Three CBR flows are running:One from node 11 to node 3
one from node 4 to node 6, one from node 8 to node 10.
- CBR 11 3 100 512 1S 30S 0S PRECEDENCE 3
- CBR 4 6 100 512 1S 30S 0S PRECEDENCE 5
- CBR 8 10 100 512 1S 30S 0S PRECEDENCE 7

Packets of all flows should arrive destinations successfully when either 
RIPng or OSPFv3 is employed as routing protocol. 

RUN:-
----
Run '<QUALNET_HOME>/bin/qualnet IPv6-routing-protocol.config'.



DESCRIPTION OF THE FILES:-
-------------------------
1. IPv6-routing-protocol.app -  QualNet configuration file for application input.
2. IPv6-routing-protocol.config - QualNet configuration input file.
3. IPv6-routing-protocol.nodes - QualNet node placement file for the simulation run.
4. IPv6-routing-protocol.expected.stat - QualNet statistics collection.
6. README - This file.
