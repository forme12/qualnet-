PURPOSE:-
-------
To test the Admission control scheme procedure for 802.16 network.

SCENARIO:-
---------
One subnet is present in the scenario, having one base station (BS) and four
subscriber stations (SS). Nodes 2 thru 4 are SS and  Node 1 is BS.

TOPOLOGY:
---------


                1 (BS)
            2               5
                 3        4


                                                  
                         
CBR flows are.


- CBR 2 5 2000 2000 5MS 12.0S 0S PRECEDENCE 7 // Application accept
- CBR 4 3 2000 2000 10MS 13S 0S PRECEDENCE 7 // Application accept
- CBR 4 3 1 2000 1MS 13.5S 0S PRECEDENCE 7 // Application reject for
Admission-Control-Basic.config due to limited range of bandwidth availability.
- CBR 4 3 40 40 1S 18S 0S PRECEDENCE 7 // Application accept


There are two config files one is Admission-Control with Basic option and the other
is Admission-Control with None option.


For Admission-Control-Basic.config 1 CBR application is rejected due to limited range
of bandwidth availability, whereas for Admission-Control-None.config, all the
applications are accepted.

RUN:-
----
Run '<QUALNET_HOME>/bin/qualnet Admission-Control-Basic.config'.
Run '<QUALNET_HOME>/bin/qualnet Admission-Control-None.config'.
