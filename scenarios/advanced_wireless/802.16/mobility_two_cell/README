PURPOSE:-
--------
To test the basic handover functionality of IEEE 802.16e.


SCENARIO:-
---------
2 subnets 192.0.0.0 and 192.0.1.0
192.0.0.0 has 4 nodes (1 to 4) with 1 as base station (BS) and rests as MS
192.0.1.0 has 4 nodes (5 to 8) with 5 as BS and rests as MS

Both node 5 and node 8 connect to node 9 via wired point-to-point links.

The two BSs (node 1 and node 5) are operating on different wireless
channels. Node 1 is operating on channel 0 and node 5 is operating on
channel 1.

Node 3 moves from left to right. It is original close to BS node 1. So it
register with BS node 1. When it moves to right, it will perform handover
to BS node 5.

        ----------- 9 -----------
       |                         |
       1 (BS)                    5 (BS)
   2        4                6
                                      8
       3                         7 

A CBR flow is from node 9 to node 3.
