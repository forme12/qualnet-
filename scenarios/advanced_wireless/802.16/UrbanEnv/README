PURPOSE:
---------
To demonstrate a WiMAX system working in urban enviroment, i.e., 
unban terrain and urban propagation.



SCENARIO:
----------
Seven wireless subnets are created with 1 BS node in each subnet. The BSs
(node 1 to node 4) are deployed in a urban area with buildings, streets,
and a park in it. The BSs (node 5 to node 7) are deployed in suburban area. 
Compared with those BS in urban area, the BSs in suburban area have much 
larger coverage area. The BSs are connected to a switch center (node 8)
by wired links. Node 9 to node 16 are SSs. When node 16 travels
from the suburban area to the urban area and finally back to the suburban
area, a CBR flow between node 16 and node 15 is handovers 
happens between these BSs.
