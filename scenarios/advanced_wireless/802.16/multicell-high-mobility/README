PURPOSE:-
--------
To test the basic handover functionality of IEEE 802.16e
in multicell environment and with high mobility.


SCENARIO:-
---------
6 subnets 192.0.6.0, 192.0.7.0, 192.0.8.0, 192.0.9.0, 192.0.10.0, 192.0.11.0
192.0.6.0 has 4 nodes (1 to 4) with 4 as BS and rests as MS
192.0.7.0 has 4 nodes (5 to 8) with 5 as BS and rests as MS
192.0.8.0 has 4 nodes (9 to 12) with 10 as BS and rests as MS
192.0.9.0 has 4 nodes (13 to 16) with 13 as BS and rests as MS
192.0.10.0 has 4 nodes (17 to 20) with 17 as BS and rests as MS
192.0.11.0 has 4 nodes (21 to 24) with 21 as BS and rests as MS

All the BSs connect to node 25 via wired point-to-point links.

Each subnet operates with different radio frequency

Node 1 moves from left to right, then from right o left. 
It is originally close to BS node 4. So it
register with BS node 4. When it moves to right, it will perform handover
to BS node 5, then handover to BS node 10, then handover to BS node 21,
then handover to BS node 17, then handover to BS node 13, 
and finally handover to original BS node 4.

6 CBR flow are running:
- CBR 1 3 200 512 1S 10S 0S PRECEDENCE 2
- CBR 1 7 200 512 1S 10S 0S PRECEDENCE 4
- CBR 1 14 200 512 1S 10S 0S PRECEDENCE 5
- CBR 18 1 200 512 1S 10S 0S PRECEDENCE 4
- CBR 9 1 200 512 1S 10S 0S PRECEDENCE 3
- CBR 22 1 200 512 1S 10S 0S PRECEDENCE 0

Totally six handovers are performed. 
A number of packets are dropped due to high mobility.
