PURPOSE:-
--------
To test two separated 802.16 subnets operating on different channels.
The BSs of the two subnets are connected via a wired point-to-point link.


SCENARIO:-
---------
2 subnets 192.0.0.0 and 192.0.1.0
192.0.0.0 has 10 nodes (1 to 10) with node 1 as BS and rests as MS
192.0.1.0 has 10 nodes (11 to 20) with node 15 as BS and rests as MS

BS node 1 and BS node 15 are connected via wired point-to-point links.

The two BSs (node 1 and node 15) are operating on different wireless
channels. Node 1 is operating on channel 0 and node 15 is operating on
channel 1.

        -------------------------
       |                         |
       1 (BS)                    15 (BS)
   2  ...  10               11   ...  20
       3                         12

A CBR flow is from node 6 to node 19.
