PURPOSE:-
--------
To test the four service types, namely UGS, ertPs, rtPS, nrtPS and BE. 
Five flows are defined with different service types. They
will get different quality of service based on their service types.



SCENARIO:-
---------
Only one wireless subnet is created with 1 BS node and 5 SSs. The BS node is
 centered at the middle and 5 SSs are same distance away from the BS.
 Each SS has one flow to the BS with exactly same parameters except service type.

                                3(SS)

                     4(SS)

                             1(BS)      2(SS)


                     5(SS)     
                                6(SS)

Five CBR flows are defined for each SS to the BS with different service types.

CBR 2 1 0 1024 0.0007S 15S 0S PRECEDENCE 0 // bePs
CBR 3 1 0 1024 0.0007S 15S 0S PRECEDENCE 2 // nrtPs 
CBR 4 1 0 1024 0.0007S 15S 0S PRECEDENCE 3 // rtPs
CBR 5 1 0 1024 0.001S 15S 0S PRECEDENCE 4  // ertPs
CBR 6 1 0 1024 0.001S 15S 0S PRECEDENCE 7  // UGS

RUN:-
----
Run '<QUALNET_HOME>/bin/qualnet service-types.config'.
