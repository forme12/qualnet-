PURPOSE:-
-------
To test the IDLE-MODE functionality for 802.16 network.

SCENARIO:-
---------
Three subnets are present in the scenario,having one base station (BS) and one
subscriber station (SS) each. While in Idle Mode, SS of Sub net 0 moves to subnet
2 at 80s.

ROUTING-PROTOCOL AODV

There are two config files one with node 2 Idle Mode Enabled and the other with
Idle Mode disabled.


Idle mode avoids unwanted handover of node 2 from BS 1 to BS 3. 

The Battery charge consumed decreases drastically from 1.13 mAhr to 0.16 mAhr.
There is significant drop in energy consumed in transmit and receive mode at node
2 and little increase in energy consumed in Idle mode.Also there is quite a large
increase in time for which node is in sleep mode (46.7% to 89.9%).


RUN:-
----
Run '<QUALNET_HOME>/bin/qualnet Idle-Mode-Enable.config'.
Run '<QUALNET_HOME>/bin/qualnet Idle-Mode-Disable.config'.



DESCRIPTION OF THE FILES:-
------------------------
1.Idle-Mode-Enable.config - QualNet configuration input file with Idle-Mode Enabled.
2.Idle-Mode-Disable.config - QualNet configuration input file with Idle-Mode Disabled.
3.Idle-Mode.app    - QualNet configuration file for application input.
4.Idle-Mode.nodes  - QualNet node placement file for the simulation run.
5.Idle-Mode-Enable.expected.stat - QualNet statistics collection.
6.Idle-Mode-Disable.expected.stat - QualNet statistics collection.
