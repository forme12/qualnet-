PURPOSE:-
--------
To test the behaviour of Qualnet when total CBR flow rate is greater than 32Mbps.


SCENARIO:-
---------
Only 1 subnet 192.0.0.0 in this scenario. It has 3 nodes. Node 1 is
configured as the base station (BS). Rest nodes are subscriber
stations (SS).

          1 (BS)
   2                     
		3

There are two CBR flows in the scenario.
One CBR flow is from node 1 to node 3 and another is from node 1 to node 3.


RUN:-
----
Run '<QUALNET_HOME>/bin/qualnet single-cell.config'.



DESCRIPTION OF THE FILES:-
-------------------------
1. single-cell.app -  QualNet configuration file for application input.
2. single-cell.config - QualNet configuration input file.
3. single-cell.nodes - QualNet node placement file for the simulation run.
4. single-cell.expected.stat - QualNet statistics collection.
5. README - This file.
