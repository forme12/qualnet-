PURPOSE:-
--------
To test the interoperability between 802.16 and wired 802.3 subnet
as well as wireless 802.11 hot spots.


SCENARIO:-
---------
A WiFi hot spot running IEEE 802.11 MAC DCF. The access point (node 11)
connects to a SS (node 3) of one 802.16 access network. This 802.16 subnet
has node 1 as the base station. Node 1 connects to the wired backbone. At
the other side of the network, a 802.3 wired LAN connects to a SS of another
802.16 access network which has node 6 as the base station connecting to the
wired backbone. The topology integrate WiFi hot spot, 802.3 wired LAN,
802.16 access network, wired backbone together.

4 subnets 192.0.0.0, 192.0.1.0, 192.0.3.0 and 192.0.5.0
192.0.0.0 has 5 nodes (1 to 5) and is running 802.16 MAC with node 1 as BS.
192.0.1.0 has 5 nodes (6 to 10) and is running 802.16 MAC with node 6 as BS.
192.0.3.0 has 5 nodes (11 to 15) and is running 802.11 MAC DCF.
192.0.5.0 has 5 nodes (8, 16 to 19) and is a wired LAN (via hub) running 802.3 MAC

In addition, node 11 of subnet 192.0.3.0 connects to node 3 of 192.0.0.0 via
a wired point-to-point link.

Node 8 of subnet 192.0.1.0 has another interface connects to the hub of subnet
192.0.5.0 too.

The BS node 1 of subnet 192.0.0.0 connects to BS node 6 of subnet 192.0.1.0
