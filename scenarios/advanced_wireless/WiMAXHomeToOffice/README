PURPOSE:
---------
To demonstrate a WiMAX network that covers a metropolitan area and provides
communication services to mobile users with high speed.



SCENARIO:
----------
Four wireless subnets are created with 1 BS node in each subnet. The BSs
(node 1 to node 4) are deployed along Freeway I-10 and I-405 to 
cover the route that node 5 (SNTer) drives from the home (San Gabriel) 
to the SNT headquarter (Los Angeles). The BSs are connected to a switch
center (node 6) by wired links. When node 5 drives along the freeway, 
node 5 communicates with node 7 and the communication is handovered from
BS 1 to BS 2 to BS 3, and finally to BS 4.

          | 7(SS, SNT headquarter)


Only one CBR flow is defined between node 5 and node 7.
