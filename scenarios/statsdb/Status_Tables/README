PURPOSE:-
--------
To test the StatsDB Status tables for Node, Interface, Multicast and Queue.


SCENARIO:-
---------
Node 1 to 6 are in the same 802.11 wireless subnet.
Node 7 to 12 are in the same 802.3 wired subnet.

The mobility paths of node 1 to 6 are defined via the node position file.
Node 7 to 12 are stationary as they are wired nodes.


APPLICATIONS:-
-------------
CBR 1 6 200 64 1S 1S 28S PRECEDENCE 0
FTP/GENERIC 2 4 10 512 18S 25S PRECEDENCE 0
MCBR 1 225.0.0.0 200 64 1S 1S 28S PRECEDENCE 0

Following StatsDB Aggregate tables are configure in the config file:

1. As mobility is used in the scenario and fault is introduce for small time period on node 4 inteface, 
node status table is configured to check the status of nodes in different time periods.
STATS-DB-NODE-STATUS-TABLE YES

2. Configured Interface status in the config file to check the state/status of a node's interface having fault in introduce in the configuration.
STATS-DB-INTERFACE-STATUS-TABLE YES

3. Multicast status table is configured to check the joining and leaving the nodes in multicat group.
STATS-DB-MULTICAST-STATUS-TABLE YES

4. Queue Status table is configure to check the stat of the queue.
STATS-DB-QUEUE-STATUS-TABLE  YES



RUN:-
----
Run '<QUALNET_HOME>/bin/qualnet default.config'

-------------------------
1. default.app - QualNet configuration file for application input.
2. default.config - QualNet configuration input file.
3. default.expected.db - QualNet DB collection.
4. default.nodes - QualNet configuration file for node position.
5. la.jpg - Background image file.
6. *.png - Node icon files.
7. default.member - QualNet multicast group member file.
8. README - This file.
