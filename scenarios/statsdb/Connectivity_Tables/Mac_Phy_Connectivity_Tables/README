PURPOSE:-
--------
To test Mac and PHY connectivity table for Mac protocol MACDOT11e and PHY Model PHY802.11b operates in Multichannel mode.



SCENARIO:-
---------

             
       3                  5
          
           1 -------- 2       
   
       4                  6



Node 1 3, 4 are in one Qos enable Wireless Subnet.
Node 2 5,& 6 are in other Qos enable Wireless Subnet. 
Node 1 and 2 are QAP. and they are in a separate wired subnet.

Node 4 is sending CBR packet to 6

Following StatsDB connectivity tables are configure in the config file:
1. MAC connectivity table is configured to check the connectivity informations of supported Mac protocol.
STATS-DB-MAC-CONNECTIVITY-TABLE YES

2. PHY connectivity table is configured to check the connectivity informations of supported Physical model.
STATS-DB-PHY-CONNECTIVITY-TABLE YES

RUN:-
----
Run "<QUALNET_HOME>/bin/qualnet default.config".


DESCRIPTION OF THE FILES:-
-------------------------
1. default.app -  QualNet configuration file for application input.
2. default.config - QualNet configuration input file.
3. default.expected.stat - QualNet statistics collection.
4. default.nodes - QualNet node position file.
5. README - This file.
