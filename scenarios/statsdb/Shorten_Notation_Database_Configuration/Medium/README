PURPOSE:-
--------
To test Stats DB Tables having Level of detail of the statistics database is configured MEDIUM.



SCENARIO:-
---------

             
       6    1
          
    2          5      
   
     3       4



Node 1 2, 3, 4, 5,& 6 are in wireless subnet.

1. Following applicatios are configured in the scenario:
    i.  CBR application from node 4 to node 3 based on UDP connection
        CBR 4 3 100 512 1S 5S 0S PRECEDENCE 0
    ii. FTP/GENERIC application from node 1 to node 3 based on TCP connection.
        FTP/GENERIC 1 3 10 512 10 0S 
    iii.Multicast application from node 1 to multicast group 225.0.0.0
        MCBR 1 225.0.0.0 100 512 1S 5S 0S PRECEDENCE 0
    
2.Mac protocol is configured as MACDOT11
    MAC-PROTOCOL MACDOT11
    
3. Phy Model is used in the scenario is PHY-ABSTRACT
    PHY-MODEL PHY-ABSTRACT
    
    
Configured STATS-DB-DETAIL as MEDIUM to generated following statistics database tables:
