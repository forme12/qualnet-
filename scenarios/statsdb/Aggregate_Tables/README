2.Mac protocol is configured as MACDOT11
    MAC-PROTOCOL MACDOT11
    
3. Phy Model is used in the scenario is PHY-ABSTRACT
    PHY-MODEL PHY-ABSTRACT
    
4. Queue type is used as FIFO
   IP-QUEUE-TYPE  FIFO (#RED,RIO, and WRED are supported in statdb)
    
Following StatsDB Aggregate tables are configure in the config file:

1. Application Agggregate table is configured to check the summarized metrics for all configured applications at the Application Layer.
STATS-DB-APPLICATION-AGGREGATE-TABLE    YES

2. MAC Agggregate table is configured to check the summarized metrics of all the MAC layer data in the simulation.
STATS-DB-MAC-AGGREGATE-TABLE    YES

3. PHY Agggregate table is configured to check the summarized metrics of all the PHY layer data in the simulation.
STATS-DB-PHY-AGGREGATE-TABLE    YES

4. Network Agggregate table is configured to check the summarized metrics of all the Network layer data in the simulation
