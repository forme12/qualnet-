Purpose: To test Location Update Procedure


SCENARIO:-
--------
The Mobile Station(MS) nodes are placed in a random fashion in the covered area and move as specified in the mobility trace file. The Base Station (BS) nodes are placed to cover the desired area and are fixed in location, as is the MSC. This scenario has 9 MS's (Nodes 7 thru 15), six BS's (Nodes 1 thru 6) and one MSC (Node 16). The BS's are connected via wired LINKs to the MSC and a default route file needs to be specified to ensure messaging between them are sent on the correct interface. All BS are also connected through a wireless subnet.


                   
      MS 1(Node 7)
             BS 2(Node 3)
             \  MS 3(Node 9) 
  MS 2(Node 8)\           /BS 3(Node 2)
               \         /
                \       / MS 6(Node 12)
                 \     /
                  \___/____________ BS 6(Node 6)
    BS 1(Node 1)______ MSC (Node 16)
                  /   \ 
                 /     \ MS 7(Node 13)
                /MS 4   \ MS 9(Node 15)
 MS 8(Node 14) /(Node 10)\
 MS 6(Node 10)/           \
             /MS 5(Node 11)\ MS 7(Node 11)
    BS 4(Node 4)   BS 5(Node 5)

|______
Origin (0, 0)

MS 1 (Node 7) calls MS 5 (Node 11) at 10S and then releases the call after 30S 
MS perform Location Updation after Cell selection/Reselection and periodically.
