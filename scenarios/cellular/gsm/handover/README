PURPOSE: To test Handover when MS moves from one BS to another BS in active state.
-------

SCENARIO:-
--------
The Mobile Station(MS) nodes are placed in a random fashion in the covered area and move as specified in the mobility trace file. The Base Station(BS)nodes are placed to cover the desired area and are fixed in location, as is the MSC. This scenario has 3 MS's, four BS's  and one MSC. The BS's are connected via wired LINKs to the MSC and a default route file needs to be specified to ensure messaging between them are sent on the correct interface. All BS are also connected through a wireless subnet.

 MS 1(Node 9) calls MS 2 (Node 10) at 20S and releases link after 90S. MS 1 which has initially selected BS 1 moves into an area covered by BS 2 and performs a network-assisted handover to BS 2.
