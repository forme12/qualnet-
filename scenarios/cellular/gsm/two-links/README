PURPOSE: To test call request/GSM link between two MS at different time.
-------


SCENARIO:-
--------
The Mobile Station(MS) nodes are placed in a random fashion in the covered area and move as specified in the mobility trace file. The Base Station(BS)nodes are placed to cover the desired area and are fixed in location, as is the MSC. This scenario has 6 MS's (Nodes 1 thru 6), two BS's (Nodes 7, 8) and one MSC (Node 9). The BS's are connected via wired LINKs to the MSC and a default route file needs to be specified to ensure messaging between them are sent on the correct interface. All BS are also connected through a wireless subnet.


                   
      MS 1(Node 1)
             BS 2(Node 8)
             \  MS 3(Node 3) 
  MS 2(Node 2)\ 
               \
                \
                 \
                  \___
                   ___ MSC (Node 9)
                  /
                 / 
                /MS 4(Node 4)

  MS 6(Node 6)/         
             / MS 5(Node 5)

Origin (0, 0)

MS 2 (Node 2) calls MS 4 (Node 4) at 5S and then releases the call at 30S.
MS 2 (Node 2) again calls MS 4 (Node 4) at 40S and then releases the call at 20S.
