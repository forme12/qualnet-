PURPOSE:-
--------
It is an example scenario to test the GSM call establishment between 
two nodes.


SCENARIO:-
---------   
                    5(MS)                           
               Wireless Subnet                   
                -----------                                             
        10(MS)  |          |    4(MS)   6(MS)                           
                | 1(BS)-|  |                                            
                |       +--+-------3 (MSC)                              
                | 2(BS)-|  |  Link    7(MS)                             
                -----------                                             
           9(MS)                    8(MS)                               

There are 10 nodes in scenario. Node 1 and 2 are BS in a wireless subnet
and connected to an MSC (node 3) through a wired link.
All other nodes are MS.

APPLICATIONS:-
-------------
GSM 5 8 18S 10S
GSM 9 6 15S 12S


RUN:-
----
Run '<QUALNET_HOME>/bin/qualnet GSMExample.config'
