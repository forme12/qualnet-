PURPOSE:-
--------
To test the functionality of IEEE 802.16
when running with multicast and unicast applications.


SCENARIO:-
---------
1 wireless subnets 192.0.0.0
192.0.0.0 has 5 nodes (3 to 7) with node 3 as base station (BS) 
and rests as MS

node 13 is a switch.

node 1 connects node 2 via wired point-to-point link.
node 2 connects node 3 via wired point-to-point link.
node 4 connects node 8 via wired point-to-point link.
node 5 connects node 11 via wired point-to-point link.
node 6 connects node 13 via wired point-to-point link.
node 8 connects node 9 via wired point-to-point link.
node 8 connects node 10 via wired point-to-point link.
node 11 connects node 12 via wired point-to-point link.
node 13 connects node 14 via wired point-to-point link.
node 13 connects node 15 via wired point-to-point link.

A MCBR flow is from node 1 to multicast group 225.0.0.1. 
The multicast group includes nodes {7 9 10 12 14}. 
- MCBR 1 225.0.0.1 0 512 1S 50S 3M

A CBR flow is from node 9 to node 1.
- CBR 9 1 0 512 1S 50S 3M PRECEDENCE 5

A CBR flow is from node 10 to node 15.
- CBR 10 15 0 512 1S 50S 3M PRECEDENCE 7

OSPFv2 and MOSPF are unicast routing and multicast 
routing protocols respectively.

The unicast and multicast packets should be successfully 
received by their destinations.

RUN:-
----
Run '<QUALNET_HOME>/bin/qualnet multicast.config'.
