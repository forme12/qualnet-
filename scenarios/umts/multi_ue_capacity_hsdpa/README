PURPOSE:-
--------
This scenario is the example for the capacity of a single cell with 
trafiic flows among multiple UEs (HSDPA is enabled).



SCENARIO:-
---------

There are total 60 CBR flows with rate about 4 kbps each at same
precedence level (Packet Switch) between IP
network and UMTS network. It consists of one
NodeB (node 5), one RNC (node 4), one SGSN (node 2), one GGSN (node 1), one HLR
(node 3) and 40 UEs (node 6 to 45), which forms a simple PLMN. The GGSN also
connects to the IP network which consists of 10 nodes. All UE are within NodeB’s
coverage.

RUN:-
----
Run '<QUALNET_HOME>/bin/qualnet multi_ue_capacity_hsdpa.config'.


DESCRIPTION OF THE FILES:-
-------------------------
1. multi_ue_capacity_hsdpa.app -  QualNet configuration file for application input.
2. multi_ue_capacity_hsdpa.config - QualNet configuration input file.
3. multi_ue_capacity_hsdpa.expected.stat - QualNet statistics collection.
4. multi_ue_capacity_hsdpa.nodes - QualNet node position file.
5. README - This file.
