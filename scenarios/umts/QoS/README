PURPOSE:-
--------
This scenario is the example of QoS support of a UMTS network.



SCENARIO:-
---------

There are total 4 CBR flows from node 20 to node
26 at rate about 450 kbps each, the precedence level of the flows are 0, 1, 4 and 6 which
represents background, interactive, streaming and conversational application traffic
respectively. It consists of one NodeB (node 5),
one RNC (node 4), one SGSN (node 3), one GGSN (node 2), one HLR (node 1) and 20
UEs (node 6 to 25), which forms a simple PLMN. The GGSN also connects to the IP
network which consists of 4 nodes. All UE are within NodeB’s coverage.


RUN:-
----
Run '<QUALNET_HOME>/bin/qualnet QoS.config'.


DESCRIPTION OF THE FILES:-
-------------------------
1. QoS.app -  QualNet configuration file for application input.
2. QoS.config - QualNet configuration input file.
3. QoS.expected.stat - QualNet statistics collection.
4. QoS.nodes - QualNet node position file.
5. README - This file.
