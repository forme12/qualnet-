PURPOSE:-
--------
This scenario shows how to use the parameter "UMTS-UE-POWER-ON-TIME".


SCENARIO:-
---------

There is a CBR flow between node 18 and node 29 and between node 27 and 
node 34. Here we use routing protocol OSPFv2.
It consists of one HLR (node 1), one GGSN (node 2), one SGSN (node 3), 
two RNCs (node 4 and 5), two NodeBs (node 6 and 7)  and 
6 UEs (node 8 to 41) which forms a simple PLMN. Routing protocol OSPFv2 
takes around 40s to create routing table. UE normally send location 
update to HLR during 1st second itself. Since no forwarding table is 
available at that time, SGSN will not be able to forward location update 
to HLR. So no location entries will be formed in HLR. Since no location 
entries for UEs are available from HLR, GGSN will not be able to forward 
packets to UE.

This behaviour can be fixed by configuring the Power ON time of UEs as 
40S using parameter "UMTS-UE-POWER-ON-TIME", so that forwarding table will 
be created by that time.
