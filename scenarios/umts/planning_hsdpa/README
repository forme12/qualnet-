PURPOSE:-
--------
This scenario is the example of planning of a 
small scale UMTS network(HSDPA is enabled).


SCENARIO:-
---------

There are three nodeBs with different
configuration parameters such as antenna gain, transmitter power, antenna height, etc.,
they use the same uplink and downlink frequency, the upside two nodeB have less
coverage dimension comparing to the downside one, while the down part has less UE
density, i.e., they sever balance load with different coverage dimensions. There are 6
CBR flows with rate about 450 kbps each at same precedence level (Packet Switch)
between IP network and UMTS network. It consists of three NodeB (node 5, 6 and 7), one
RNC (node 4), one SGSN (node 2), one GGSN (node 3), one HLR (node 1) and 48 UEs
(node 14 to 61), which forms a simple PLMN. The GGSN also connects to the IP
network which consists of 6 nodes.

RUN:-
----
Run '<QUALNET_HOME>/bin/qualnet planning_hsdpa.config'.
