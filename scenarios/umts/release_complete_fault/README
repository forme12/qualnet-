PURPOSE:-
--------
This scenario is an example to show the behavior of RNC when it receives RRC CONNECTION 
REQUEST before RRC CONNECTION RELEASE COMPLETE.


SCENARIO:-
---------

There are 3 CBR flows from node
27 (UE) to 39 (node in PDN) and 2 CBR flows from node 38 (node in PDN) to 12 (UE)
at rate about 450 kbps each, the precedence level of the flows are the same. 
It consists of one NodeB (node 5), one RNC (node 3), one
SGSN (node 1), one GGSN (node 2), one HLR (node 4) and 30 UEs (node 6 to 35),
which forms a simple PLMN. The GGSN also connects to the IP network which consists
of 4 nodes. All UE are within NodeB’s coverage.


RUN:-
----
Run '<QUALNET_HOME>/bin/qualnet release_complete_fault.config'.


DESCRIPTION OF THE FILES:-
-------------------------
1. release_complete_fault.app -  QualNet configuration file for application input.
2. release_complete_fault.config - QualNet configuration input file.
3. release_complete_fault.expected.stat - QualNet statistics collection.
4. release_complete_fault.nodes - QualNet node position file.
5. README - This file.
