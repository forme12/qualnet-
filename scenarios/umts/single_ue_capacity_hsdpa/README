PURPOSE:-
--------
This scenario is the example for the capacity of 
a UE in terms of throughput with multiple traffic flows
between 2 UEs(HSDPA is enabled).


SCENARIO:-
---------

There are 4 CBR flows from node
27 (UE) to 39 (node in PDN) and 4 CBR flows from node 38 (node in PDN) to 12 (UE)
at rate about 450 kbps each, the precedence level of the flows are the same. 
It consists of one NodeB (node 5), one RNC (node 3), one
SGSN (node 1), one GGSN (node 2), one HLR (node 4) and 30 UEs (node 6 to 35),
which forms a simple PLMN. The GGSN also connects to the IP network which consists
of 4 nodes. All UE are within NodeB’s coverage.


RUN:-
