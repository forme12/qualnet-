PURPOSE:-
--------
This scenario is the example of handover of a mobile UE between 2 NodeBs.


SCENARIO:-
---------

There is a CBR flow between node 8
and node 11 and node 8 moves between nodeB 1 and nodeB 2’s coverage, 
two nodeBs are handover when node 8 is within his coverage. It consists of
two NodeBs (node 1 and 2), one RNC (node 3), one SGSN (node 4), 
one GGSN (node 5), one HLR (node 12) and 6 UEs (node 6 to 11), 
which forms a simple PLMN.


RUN:-
----
Run '<QUALNET_HOME>/bin/qualnet handover.config'.


DESCRIPTION OF THE FILES:-
-------------------------
1. handover.app -  QualNet configuration file for application input.
2. handover.config - QualNet configuration input file.
3. handover.expected.stat - QualNet statistics collection.
4. handover.nodes - QualNet node position file.
5. README - This file.
