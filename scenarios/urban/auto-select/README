The auto-select model has a lot of choices.  The scenarios here cover all of
those choices except free space (no buildings on path and relatively short
range) and two-ray (default).

This list details the scenarios and the situation that causes that model
selection:
 * cost_wi/los:           one node on a roof, the other at street level at a distance.
 * cost_wi/nlos:          one node on a tall roof, the other three streets away at
                          ground level.
 * itu_r/los_15GHz:       nodes at ground level 1500m apart
 * itu_r/los_5GHz:        nodes at ground level 500m apart
 * itu_r/mobility:        node moving through the urban area.  200MHz frequency.
 * itu_r/nlos1_5GHz:      nodes on adjacent streets.
 * itu_r/nlos2_5GHz:      nodes on perpendicular streets.
 * itu_r/nlos:            nodes on perpendicular streets.  700MHz frequency.
 * itu_r/uhf_los_780MHz:  nodes with LoS.
 * itu_r/uhf_nlos_780MHz: nodes with NLoS.
 * itu_r/vhf_los_200MHz:  nodes with LoS.
 * itu_r/vhf_nlos_200MHz: nodes with NLoS.
 * m_to_m/m_to_m:         1.5GHz, nodes on neighboring streets, 2 buildings away.
 * street_microcell/los:  1.5GHz, nodes on same street, 400m away.
 * street_microcell/nlos: 1.5GHz, nodes on neighboring streets, 1 building away.
