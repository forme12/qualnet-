The scenarios in this folder exercise specific urban propagation models with
fixed parameters.

These scenarios are useful for testing the propagation algorithms (by setting
DEBUG = 1 in libraries/wireless/src/propagation.cpp), but are not useful 
generally because when specified this way, the propagation models don't use
the available terrain data.

Some of these scenarios increase the ANTENNA-GAIN parameter to get
communication between the nodes, but in other cases, failed communication seems
appropriate.
