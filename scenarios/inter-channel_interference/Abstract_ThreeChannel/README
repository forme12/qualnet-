PURPOSE:-
-------
To test Inter-channel Inteference Model in Phy_Abstract.

SCENARIO:-
---------
The scenario consists of 6 nodes. Nodes 1 and 2 work on one channel, 
node 3 and 4 work on second channel and 6 and 7 work on third channel.
Nodes 1,4 and 7 are at the same position and nodes 2,3 and 6 are at the same position.

			|1/4/7|--------------|2/3/6|
			|_ _ _|--------------|_ _ _|
										 

Application:
------------
CBR session is configured between Node 1 and Node 2, Node 4 and Node 3, 
Node 7 and Node 6.


Scenario consists of two config files.
For Abstract_ThreeChannel_yes.config, 
parameter PROPAGATION-ENABLE-CHANNEL-OVERLAP-CHECK is set to YES for all channels.
For Abstract_ThreeChannel_no.config, 
parameter PROPAGATION-ENABLE-CHANNEL-OVERLAP-CHECK is set to NO for all channels.


RUN:-
----
Run '<QUALNET_HOME>/bin/qualnet Abstract_ThreeChannel_yes.config'.
Run '<QUALNET_HOME>/bin/qualnet Abstract_ThreeChannel_no.config'.

DESCRIPTION OF THE FILES:-
------------------------
1. Abstract_ThreeChannel.app - QualNet configuration file for application input.
2. Abstract_ThreeChannel_yes.config - QualNet configuration input file.
3. Abstract_ThreeChannel_no.config - QualNet configuration input file.
4. Abstract_ThreeChannel_yes.expected.stat - QualNet statistics collection.
5. Abstract_ThreeChannel_no.expected.stat - QualNet statistics collection.
6. Abstract_ThreeChannel.nodes - QualNet node placement file for the simulation run.
7. README - This file.
