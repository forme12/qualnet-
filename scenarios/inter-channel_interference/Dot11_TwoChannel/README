PURPOSE:-
-------
To test Inter-channel Inteference Model in Phy_802.11.

SCENARIO:-
---------
The scenario consists of 4 nodes. Nodes 1 and 2 work on one channel whereas
node 3 and 4 work on another channel.Nodes 2 and 3 are at the same position.

TOPOLOGY:
---------

					  _ _ _
			1----------------|     |
					 | 2/3 |
			4----------------|_ _ _|
										 

Application:
------------
CBR session is configured between Node 1 and Node 2, Node 4 and Node 3.


Scenario consists of two config files.
For Dot11_TwoChannel_yes.config, 
parameter PROPAGATION-ENABLE-CHANNEL-OVERLAP-CHECK is set to YES for both channels.
For Dot11_TwoChannel_no.config,
parameter PROPAGATION-ENABLE-CHANNEL-OVERLAP-CHECK is set to NO for both channels.


RUN:-
----
Run '<QUALNET_HOME>/bin/qualnet Dot11_TwoChannel_yes.config'.
Run '<QUALNET_HOME>/bin/qualnet Dot11_TwoChannel_no.config'.

DESCRIPTION OF THE FILES:-
------------------------
1. Dot11_TwoChannel_yes.config - QualNet configuration input file.
2. Dot11_TwoChannel_no.config - QualNet configuration input file.
3. Dot11_TwoChannel.app - QualNet configuration file for application input.
4. Dot11_TwoChannel.nodes  - QualNet node placement file for the simulation run.
5. Dot11_TwoChannel_yes.expected.stat - QualNet statistics collection.
6. Dot11_TwoChannel_no.expected.stat - QualNet statistics collection.
7. README - This file.
