PURPOSE:-
--------
To test the Inter-channel Interference for PHY802.15.4.


SCENARIO:-
---------
Node 1, 2, 3 , 4 and 5 are placed in single wireless subnet working on one channel. 
Node 1 is a PAN Coordinator. Nodes 2, 3, 4 and 5 are RFDs.
Node 6, 7, 8 and 9 are placed in different wireless subnet working on different channel. 
Node 6 is a PAN Coordinator. Nodes 7, 8 and 9 are RFDs.
Nodes 5 and 7, nodes 1 and 6, nodes 4 and 8 are at same position.

                                                                  _ _ _
                                                                 |     |

Application:
------------
CBR session is configured between Node 1 and Node 4, Node 1 and Node 5, 
Node 6 and Node 7,Node 6 and Node 8.


Scenario consists of two config files.
For Zigbee_TwoChannel_yes.config,
parameter PROPAGATION-ENABLE-CHANNEL-OVERLAP-CHECKis set to YES for all channels.
For Zigbee_TwoChannel_no.config, 
parameter PROPAGATION-ENABLE-CHANNEL-OVERLAP-CHECK is set to NO for all channels.


RUN:-
----
Run "<QUALNET_HOME>/bin/qualnet Zigbee_TwoChannel_yes.config".
Run "<QUALNET_HOME>/bin/qualnet Zigbee_TwoChannel_no.config".


DESCRIPTION OF THE FILES:-
-------------------------
1. Zigbee_TwoChannel.app -  QualNet configuration file for application input.
2. Zigbee_TwoChannel_yes.config - QualNet configuration input file.
3. Zigbee_TwoChannel_no.config - QualNet configuration input file.
4. Zigbee_TwoChannel_yes.expected.stat - QualNet statistics collection.
5. Zigbee_TwoChannel_no.expected.stat - QualNet statistics collection.
6. Zigbee_TwoChannel.nodes - QualNet node placement file for the simulation run.
7. README - This file.
