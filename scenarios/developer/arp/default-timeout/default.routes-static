# default.routes-static, static route file
#
# Syntax:
#
# <nodeId> <destAddress> <nextHop> [outgoing_interface] [cost]
#
# destAddress can be either a host IP address or network IP address.
# nextHop and outgoing_interface must be host IP addresses.  cost must
# be an integer.
#
# outgoing_interface and cost are optional.
#
# For wired scenarios, routes to directly connected networks are
# added automatically.  These routes do not need to be specified in
# this file.
#

#
# The example below is for the 4-node, wired network example in
# default.config.  Note that routes to directly connected networks are
# not specified (e.g., node 1 does not need a static route to N2-1.0).
