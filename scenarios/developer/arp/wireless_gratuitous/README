PURPOSE:
-------

To verify Gratuitous ARP packet generation.



TOPOLOGY CONVENTIONS:
--------------------

--------- means a wireless link.

-----------
|        |
|        |    means a wireless subnet.
|        |

---------------------- 
    


KEY CONFIGURATION:
------------------

MAC-PROTOCOL    CSMA
ARP-ENABLED YES



Application:
------------

CBR application is configured between node 1 and node 2.



DESCRIPTION:
------------

The Scenario is used to verify gratuitous ARP packet generation and subsequent functioning of ARP. 
For this purpose, an Interface card fault is introduced at node 1 which enables gratuitous ARP packet generation at this node at 5M. 
This packet enables other nodes to update there ARP cache with new MAC address.



RUN:
----

Type '<QUALNET_HOME>/bin/qualnet wireless_gratuitous.config'.



DESCRIPTION OF THE FILES:
-------------------------

1. wireless_gratuitous.app -  specifies the application being used.
2. wireless_gratuitous.config - the QualNet configuration input file.
3. wireless_gratuitous.expected.stat - QualNet statistics collection
4. wireless_gratuitous.fault - Qualnet configuration file for faults.
5. wireless_gratuitous.nodes - QualNet node position file.
6. wireless_gratuitous.routes-default - Qualnet default route file.
7. wireless_gratuitous.routes-static - Qualnet static route file.
8. README - this file.
