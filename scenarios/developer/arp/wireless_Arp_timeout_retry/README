PURPOSE:
--------

To verify the operation of ARP timeout and ARP retries.



TOPOLOGY CONVENTIONS:
--------------------

--------- means a wireless link.

-----------
|        |
|        |    means a wireless subnet.
|        |
----------

_________ means a static route.

----------



KEY CONFIGURATION:
------------------

MAC-PROTOCOL    802.11
ARP-ENABLED YES



Application:
------------

CBR application is configured between node 1, node 2 and node 4, node 3.



DESCRIPTION:
------------

This scenario is used to verify ARP timeout and ARP retry functionality.
ARP timeout is manually configured to 10M and an interface fault is introduced at node 2 starting from 10M. Any attempt to resolve the 
MAC address of node 2 between 10 and 20M will lead to ARP retries as node 2 is down.



RUN:
----

Type '<QUALNET_HOME>/bin/qualnet wireless_Arp_timeout_retry.config'.



DESCRIPTION OF THE FILES:
-------------------------

1. wireless_Arp_timeout_retry.app -  QualNet configuration file for application input.
2. wireless_Arp_timeout_retry.config - QualNet configuration input file.
3. wireless_Arp_timeout_retry.expected.stat - QualNet statistics collection
4. wireless_Arp_timeout_retry.fault - Qualnet configuration file for faults.
5. wireless_Arp_timeout_retry.nodes - QualNet node position file.
6. wireless_Arp_timeout_retry.routes-default - Qualnet default route file.
7. wireless_Arp_timeout_retry.routes-static - Qualnet static route file.
8. README - this file.
