PURPOSE:
--------

To verify the operation of ARP with two wireless subnets connected via common node.



TOPOLOGY CONVENTIONS:
--------------------

--------- means a wireless link.

-----------
|        |
|        |    means a wireless subnet.
|        |
----------

_________ means a static route.

           ---------------------



KEY CONFIGURATION:
------------------

MAC-PROTOCOL    CSMA
ARP-ENABLED YES
MAC-ADDRESS-CONFIG-FILE     ./wireless_subnet1.mac-address



Application:
------------

CBR application is configured between node 1 and node 9.



DESCRIPTION:
------------

The scenario is used to verify ARP functionality with custom MAC addresses and two wireless subnets connected via common node.
Node 18 serves as a common node connecting two subnets. Application packets from node 1 towards node 9 are routed via node 18 
which maintains ARP entries for both the interfaces connected to it.



RUN:
----

Type '<QUALNET_HOME>/bin/qualnet wireless_subnet1.config'.



DESCRIPTION OF THE FILES:
-------------------------

1. wireless_subnet1.app -  specifies the application being used.
2. wireless_subnet1.config - the QualNet configuration input file.
3. wireless_subnet1.expected.stat - QualNet statistics collection
4. wireless_subnet1.nodes - QualNet node position file.
5. wireless_subnet1.routes-default - Qualnet default route file.
6. wireless_subnet1.routes-static - Qualnet static route file.
7. wireless_subnet1.mac-address - Mac Address configuration file
8. README - this file.
