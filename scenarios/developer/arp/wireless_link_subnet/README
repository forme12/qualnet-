PURPOSE:
--------

To verify the operation of Arp with two wireless subnets connected via static link.



TOPOLOGY CONVENTIONS:
--------------------

--------- means a wireless link.

-----------
|        |
|        |    means a wireless subnet.
|        |
----------

_________ means a static route.

KEY CONFIGURATION:
------------------

MAC-PROTOCOL    TDMA
ARP-ENABLED YES



Application:
------------

FTP/GENERIC application is configured between node 4 and node 16.



DESCRIPTION:
------------

The scenario is used to verify the working of ARP with 2 wireless subnets connected via a static link between two nodes.
ARP request/response takes place between nodes 7 and 9 (connected via link) in order to send application packets across the wireless networks.



RUN:
----

Type '<QUALNET_HOME>/bin/qualnet wireless_link_subnet.config'.



DESCRIPTION OF THE FILES:
-------------------------

1. wireless_link_subnet.app -  specifies the application being used.
2. wireless_link_subnet.config - the QualNet configuration input file.
3. wireless_link_subnet.expected.stat - QualNet statistics collection
4. wireless_link_subnet.nodes - QualNet node position file.
5. wireless_link_subnet.routes-default - Qualnet default route file.
6. wireless_link_subnet.routes-static - Qualnet static route file.
7. README - this file.
