PURPOSE:
--------

To verify the operation of ARP with ARP static-cache.



TOPOLOGY CONVENTIONS:
--------------------

--------- means a wireless link.

-----------
|        |
|        |    means a wireless subnet.
|        |
----------

_________ means a static route.

KEY CONFIGURATION:
------------------

MAC-PROTOCOL    CSMA
ARP-ENABLED YES
MAC-ADDRESS-CONFIG-FILE     ./wireless_staticCache.mac-address
STATIC-CACHE-FILE           ./wireless_staticCache.arp-static



Application:
------------

CBR application is configured between node 1 and node 3.



DESCRIPTION:
-------------

The scenario is used to verify ARP functionality with ARP static cache.
Static cache having Ip and MAC address mappings is used and it enables address resolution without ARP request and responses. Since, no ARP 
requests/responses takes place, MAC addresses are configured via custom MAC address file. 



RUN:
-----

Type '<QUALNET_HOME>/bin/qualnet default.config'.



DESCRIPTION OF THE FILES:
-------------------------

1. wireless_staticCache.app -  specifies the application being used.
2. wireless_staticCache.config - the QualNet configuration input file.
3. wireless_staticCache.expected.stat - QualNet statistics collection
4. wireless_staticCache.mac-address - Mac Address configuration file.
5. wireless_staticCache.arp-static - Static Cache configuration file.
6. wireless_staticCache.nodes - QualNet node position file.
7. wireless_staticCache.routes-default - Qualnet default route file.
8. wireless_staticCache.routes-static - Qualnet static route file.
9. README - this file.
