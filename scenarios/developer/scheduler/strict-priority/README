PURPOSE:-
--------
Test STRICT-PRIORITY scheduler behavior at intermediate node. Packets with
priority ‘0’ is considered to be highest priority and will be served as soon
as they arrive at intermediate node, leading to the phenomenon of lower
priority queue starvation.


SCENARIO:-
---------

--------- means a link.

Node 3 sends 6000000 packet to Node 1 with priority 1.  After some time,
Node 4 sends 6000000 packet to Node 1 with priority 0.


RUN:-
----
Run '<QUALNET_HOME>/bin/qualnet strict-priority.config'.
