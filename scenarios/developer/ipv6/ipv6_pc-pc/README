PURPOSE:-
--------
To test the functionality of WLAN for multiple subnets.


SCENARIO:-
---------
2 subnets 1.0 and 10.0.
1.0  has 5 nodes (1 to 5) with 1 as PC.
10.0 has 4 nodes (10 to 13) with 10 as PC.

Both the subnets (particularly the PCs) are beyond
each other's receive range and are connected with a wired link.

PCF values are set at default.
