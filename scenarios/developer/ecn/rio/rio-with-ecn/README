PURPOSE:-
--------
Shows the behavior of the RIO with ECN.


SCENARIO:-
---------
In this scenario, there is one TCP session,
with node 1 being the source and node 5 being the destination.
IP QUEUE type is FIFO at all nodes except node 3 where it is 
configured as RIO. ECN is enabled at all nodes.



      s1(node 1)                            s3(node 5)
       \                                   /
10Mb,2ms \           1.5Mb,20ms          / 10Mb,4ms
          r1(node 3) --------- r2(node 4)
10Mb,3ms /                               \ 10Mb,5ms
       /                                   \
      s2(node 2)                            s4(node 6)


APPLICATIONS:-
-------------
FTP/GENERIC is used to transfer data segments of 1000B each
starting from 0 second to the end of simulation, which is 10 seconds.


RUN:-
----
