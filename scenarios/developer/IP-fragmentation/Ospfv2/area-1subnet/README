PURPOSE:-
--------
To show the operation of IP Fragmentation for ospfv2 in a domain divided
into several areas.



SCENARIO:-
---------
In this scenario, there are two CBR sessions, with node 1 and node 6 being
the sources and node 9 and node 2 being the corresponding destinations.
Sources and destinations belong to different areas.



    Area 1                             Area 2
  -----------                        -----------
  | 1     2 |                        | 6     7 |
  |         |        Area 0          |         |
  |        3+------------------------+8        |
  |         |                        |         |
  | 4     5 |                        | 9    10 |
  -----------                        -----------


CBR is used to transfer 10 data segments of 2020B each at 5 second intervals
starting at 70 minutes into the simulation.



RUN:-
----

Run '<QUALNET_HOME>/bin/qualnet area_1subnet.config'.
