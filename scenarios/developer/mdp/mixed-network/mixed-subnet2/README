PURPOSE:-
--------
To test MDP behaviour in mixed network having wireless-wired-wireles
topology.


SCENARIO:-
---------

 (1)- - - - - |              |- - - - - (6)
              |     wired    |
  Wireless   (3) - - - - - - (5)    Wireless
              |      link    |
 (2)- - - - - |              |- - - - - (7)



Nodes 1 to 3 are in one wireless subnet. Nodes 5 to 7 are in second  
wireless subnet. Node 3 and 5 are connected with a wired link as shown in 
the Figure. Nodes 1, 2, 6, 7 are in multicast group.


RUN:-
----
Run '<QUALNET_HOME>/bin/qualnet mixed-subnet2.config'.

DESCRIPTION OF THE FILES:-
-------------------------
1. mixed-subnet2.app -  QualNet configuration file for application input.
2. mixed-subnet2.config - QualNet configuration input file.
3. mixed-subnet2.nodes - QualNet node placement file for the simulation run.
4. mixed-subnet2.member - QualNet configuration file for multicast member.
5. mixed-subnet2.routes-default - QualNet configuration file for default route.
6. mixed-subnet2.mdp - QualNet configuration file for MDP profile.
7. soccer.trc - Trace file for Traffic-Trace application. 
8. mixed-subnet2.expected.stat - QualNet statistics collection.
9. README - This file.
