PURPOSE:-
--------
To test MDP behaviour in mixed network having wired-wireles-wired topology.


SCENARIO:-
---------

 (3)- - - - - |                       |- - - - - (8)
              |        wireless       |
     Wired   (10) - - - 5 to 7 - - - (11)     Wired
              |                       |
 (4)- - - - - |                       |- - - - - (9)



Nodes 3, 4, 10 are in one wired subnet. Nodes 11, 8, 9, are in second wired 
subnet. Nodes 5, 6, 7 are in a wireless subnet as shown in 
the Figure. Nodes 3, 4, 6, 8, 9 are in multicast group.


RUN:-
----
Run '<QUALNET_HOME>/bin/qualnet mixed-subnet1.config'.

DESCRIPTION OF THE FILES:-
-------------------------
1. mixed-subnet1.app -  QualNet configuration file for application input.
2. mixed-subnet1.config - QualNet configuration input file.
3. mixed-subnet1.nodes - QualNet node placement file for the simulation run.
4. mixed-subnet1.member - QualNet configuration file for multicast member.
5. mixed-subnet1.mdp - QualNet configuration file for MDP profile.
6. soccer.trc - Trace file for Traffic-Trace application. 
7. mixed-subnet1.expected.stat - QualNet statistics collection.
8. README - This file.
