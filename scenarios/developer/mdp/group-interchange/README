PURPOSE:-
--------
To test MDP behaviour in an adhoc network having interchanging their
multicast group.


SCENARIO:-
---------

       --------------------------->
  (1)                                  (6)
       <--------------------------- 
  
           (3)       (4)      (5)
  
  
       --------------------------->  
  (2)                                  (7)
       <--------------------------- 


Nodes 1 to 7 are in an adhoc wirless network. Node 1, 2, 6, 7 are 
mobile nodes. Node 1 and 6 are interchanging their positions along
with their milticast groups. Similarly, node 2 and 7 are 
interchanging their positions along with their milticast groups.


Nodes 1, 2 are in multicast group 225.0.0.0 for 300S.
Nodes 6, 7 are in multicast group 225.0.0.1 for 300S.
Nodes 1, 2 are in multicast group 225.0.0.1 from 300S to 1000S.
Nodes 6, 7 are in multicast group 225.0.0.0 from 300S to 1000S.


RUN:-
----
Run '<QUALNET_HOME>/bin/qualnet group-interchange.config'.

DESCRIPTION OF THE FILES:-
-------------------------
1. group-interchange.app -  QualNet configuration file for application input.
2. group-interchange.config - QualNet configuration input file.
3. group-interchange.nodes - QualNet node placement file for the simulation run.
4. group-interchange.member - QualNet configuration file for multicast member.
5. group-interchange.expected.stat - QualNet statistics collection.
6. README - This file.
