PURPOSE:-
--------
To test MDP behaviour in an adhoc network having interchanging their
multicast group.


SCENARIO:-
---------

        
       (1) - - - - (2) - - - - (3) - - - - (4)
  
 

Nodes 1 to 4 forms a wired network as shown in figure. Node 1, 2 are
connected with point-to-point link. Similarly, nodes (2,3) and (3,4)
are forming pairs with point-to-point links.Node 1 and 4 are in multicast
group.

Node 1 and node 4 interfaces are configured with faults multiple times.

RUN:-
----
Run '<QUALNET_HOME>/bin/qualnet link-fault.config'.

DESCRIPTION OF THE FILES:-
-------------------------
1. link-fault.app -  QualNet configuration file for application input.
2. link-fault.config - QualNet configuration input file.
3. link-fault.nodes - QualNet node placement file for the simulation run.
4. link-fault.member - QualNet configuration file for multicast member.
5. link-fault.fault - QualNet configuration file for interface fault.
6. soccer.trc - Trace file for Traffic-Trace application. 
7. link-fault.expected.stat - QualNet statistics collection.
8. README - This file.
