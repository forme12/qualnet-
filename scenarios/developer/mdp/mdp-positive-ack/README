PURPOSE:-
--------
To test positive acknowledgement of MDP implementation.


SCENARIO:-
---------


             (1) - - - - (2) - - - - (3)

                        
Nodes 1, 2 are connected with point-to-point link. Similarly, node 2, 3 
are connected with point-to-point link as shown in the Figure. 

All nodes lies in the multicast group. But node 2 leaves group at 60S and
rejoins at 100S. There is a interface fault at node 2 towards the link for
node 3. Positive ACKs are configured on both node 2 and 3.



RUN:-
----
Run '<QUALNET_HOME>/bin/qualnet mdp-positive-ack.config'.

DESCRIPTION OF THE FILES:-
-------------------------
1. mdp-positive-ack.app -  QualNet configuration file for application input.
2. mdp-positive-ack.config - QualNet configuration input file.
3. mdp-positive-ack.nodes - QualNet node placement file for the simulation run.
4. mdp-positive-ack.fault - QualNet configuration file for fault input
5. mdp-positive-ack.member - QualNet configuration file for multicast members.
6. mdp-positive-ack.mdp - QualNet configuration file for MDP profile.
7. soccer.trc - Trace file for Traffic-Trace application. 
8. mdp-positive-ack.expected.stat - QualNet statistics collection.
9. README - This file.
