PURPOSE:-
--------
This test case is to check header fields of TCP protocol
as per RFC and check of *.trace file so that  blank space
does not exist before closing tag of protocol e.g. </tcp>tag

SCENARIO:-
---------

------ means link connection

                      3
                     /
                    /
                   /
       1---------2
                   \
                    \
                     \
                      4  

Node 1 sends FTP packets to Node 4. 

The following parameters should be added in *.config file for
Trace Configuration.

PACKET-TRACE                    YES
TRACE-APPLICATION-LAYER         YES
TRACE-TRANSPORT-LAYER           YES
TRACE-NETWORK-LAYER             YES
TRACE-MAC-LAYER                 YES
TRACE-DIRECTION                 BOTH
TRACE-INCLUDED-HEADERS          ALL
TRACE-ALL                       YES

TRACE-TCP                       YES

RUN:-
----
Run '<QUALNET_HOME>/bin/qualnet trace-tcp.config'.
