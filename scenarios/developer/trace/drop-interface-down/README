PURPOSE:-
--------
To trace the dropped packet when the Interface is down. 

SCENARIO:-
---------

------ means link connection


       1---------2---------3


Node 1 sends 10 units (each of 512 bytes) at 1-second 
interval to Node 3.

The .app file entry as is:
CBR 1 3 10 512 1S 5M 0S

After 4 sec the link between Node 2 and Node 3 fails. 
The configuration for this interface fault should be 
mentioned as followed in .fault file.

INTERFACE-FAULT 2.1 4M 10M

The following parameters should be added in *.config file for
Trace Configuration.

PACKET-TRACE                    YES
TRACE-APPLICATION-LAYER         YES
TRACE-TRANSPORT-LAYER           YES
TRACE-NETWORK-LAYER             YES
TRACE-MAC-LAYER                 YES
TRACE-DIRECTION                 BOTH
TRACE-INCLUDED-HEADERS          ALL
TRACE-ALL                       YES

TRACE-UDP                       YES
TRACE-IP                        YES


RUN:-
----
