PURPOSE:-
--------
 This test case is to check header fields of IP and UDP 
protocol as per RFC and check *.trace file so that  blank space 
does not exist before closing tag of protocol e.g. </udp> and 
</ipv4> tag.

SCENARIO:-
---------

------ means link connection

                      3
                     /
                    /
                   /
       1---------2
                   \
                    \
                     \
                      4  

Node 1 is sending CBR packets to Node 3. 

The following parameters should be added in *.config file for
Trace Configuration.

PACKET-TRACE                    YES
TRACE-APPLICATION-LAYER         YES
TRACE-TRANSPORT-LAYER           YES
TRACE-NETWORK-LAYER             YES
TRACE-MAC-LAYER                 YES
TRACE-DIRECTION                 BOTH
TRACE-INCLUDED-HEADERS          ALL
TRACE-ALL                       YES

TRACE-UDP                       YES
TRACE-IP                        YES

RUN:-
----
Run '<QUALNET_HOME>/bin/qualnet trace-ip-udp.config'.
