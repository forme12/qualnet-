PURPOSE:-
--------
To show the operation of two satellite networks connected
by a common ground node.



SCENARIO:-
---------
In this scenario, there are two satellite networks consisting of
4 nodes each (3 ground nodes and 1 satellite node).  One CBR session
exists from node 9 to node 11.

CBR is used to transfer 100 data segments of 512B each at 1 second intervals
starting at 100S into the simulation.
