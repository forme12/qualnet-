PURPOSE:-
-------
To test the Icmp Host Unreachable error message generation in case of 
Link fault in wired point to point Network.

SCENARIO:-
--------
Four Nodes are connected in Wired Point to Point Network. All the nodes 
are ICMP enabled.Routing Protocol is configured as BELLMANFORD. At the
start of the simulation link between the Nodes 3 and 4 are
down but the Link is up after the 10 seconds and again the link is down
from 20 seconds to the end of the simulation time.
