PURPOSE:-
-------
To test the Icmp Time Exceed error message generation when there is a
routing loop.

SCENARIO:-
--------
Seven Nodes are connected in Wired Point to Point Network as shown in the
figure. All the nodes are ICMP enabled.No Routing Protocol is configured.
Static route is defined such a way that packet destined for node 6 is 
will be rotates in loop within nodes 2, 3, 4 and 5.
