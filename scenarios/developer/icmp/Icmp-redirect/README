PURPOSE:-
-------
To test the Icmp Redirect message generation in QualNet.

SCENARIO:-
--------
Nodes 1, 2, 4 are in a wired subnet And nodes 5 and 3 are connected with
node 4 and 2 respectively. Node 6 is connected with node 3 and node 5 by
wired point to point link as shown in the Figure.  Node 4 is configured 
as default gate way for node 1. One cbr application is configured between
node 1 and 3.
