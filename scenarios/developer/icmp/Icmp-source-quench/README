PURPOSE:-
-------
To test the Icmp Source Quench error message generation in case of 
wired point to point Network.

SCENARIO:-
--------
Four Nodes are connected in Wired Point to Point Network. All the nodes 
are ICMP enabled.Routing Protocol is configured as BELLMANFORD. One CBR 
application is configured between node 1 and 4 with larger data packet 
size and small time interval.
