PURPOSE:-
-------
To test ICMP of Fragmentation needed and DF set ICMP Error message in 
case of mobile multi-hop wireless scenario.


SCENARIO:-
--------
Nodes 1 to 3 are in a wireless multi-hop scenario. All the nodes are 
Icmp enabled. Routing prtocol is configured as DSR. One CBR application 
is configured between Node 1 and 3. IP fragmentation unit of node 2 is
configured as very less so that any packet greater than that needs to be 
fragmented.
