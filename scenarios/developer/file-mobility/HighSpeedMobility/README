PURPOSE:-
--------
To show how to specify mobility using file based mobility model.


SCENARIO:-
---------
Node 1 to 6 are in the same 802.11 wireless subnet.
Node 7 to 12 are in the same 802.3 wired subnet.

The mobility paths of node 1 to 6 are defined via the node position file.
Node 7 to 12 are stationary as they are wired nodes.


APPLICATIONS:-
-------------
CBR 1 6 200 64 1S 1S 28S PRECEDENCE 0
FTP/GENERIC 2 4 10 512 18S 25S PRECEDENCE 0
TELNET 7 8 10S 19S


RUN:-
----
Run '<QUALNET_HOME>/bin/qualnet HighSpeedMobility.config'


DESCRIPTION OF THE FILES:-
-------------------------
1. HighSpeedMobility.app - QualNet configuration file for application input.
2. HighSpeedMobility.config - QualNet configuration input file.
3. HighSpeedMobility.expected.stat - QualNet statistics collection.
4. HighSpeedMobility.nodes - QualNet configuration file for node position.
5. la.jpg - Background image file.
6. *.png - Node icon files.
7. README - This file.
