PURPOSE:-
-------
The files in these subdirectories show the behavior of the TCP variants
(Tahoe, Reno, Lite, Newreno, Sack) in the presence of 0, 1, 2, 3
and 4 packet drops.

The network protocol is IPv4.

SCENARIO:-
---------
In all the scenarios, there is one TCP session, with node 1 being the source
and node 4 being the destination.

This topology corresponds to net0 of ns's tcp-suite-sack.tcl

        s1 (Node 1)
         \
 10Mb,5ms \          0.8Mb,100ms
           r1 (Node 3)--------- k1 (Node 4)
 10Mb,5ms /
         /
        s2 (Node 2)


APPLICATIONS:-
-------------
FTP/GENERIC is used to transfer data segments of 1000B starting from 1
second to the end of simulation, which is 6 seconds.


SUBDIRECTORIES:-
---------------
There are 25 subdirectories covering 5 variants and 5 drops.
The five variants are Tahoe, Reno, Lite, Newreno, Sack.
The drops are 0drop, 1drop, 2drop, 3drop, 4drop.
Each subdirectory name reflects this combination,
e.g. tahoe-2drop or lite-4drop. Each subdirectory contains
the files relevant to the variant-drop combination.
These files are described below.

<scenario> refers to this variant-drop combination.


RUNNING THE SIMULATION:-
-----------------------

Change to the subdirectory for the variant-drop combination,
e.g. newreno-3drop for a NewReno simulation with 3 packet drops.

To run the simulation with a tcpdump ascii trace, use
   'pathTo/qualnet <scenario>-asciidump.config'

To run the simulation with a tcpdump binary trace, use
   'pathTo/qualnet <scenario>-binarydump.config'


VIEWING TRACE RESULTS:-
----------------------
To view the tcpdump ascii trace, view the file 'tcptrace.asc'.

The tcpdump binary trace file is 'tcptrace.dmp'.
To view graphical plots of the trace:

    - generate the plot files from the binary trace file
      using tcptrace with 'pathTo/tcptrace -nG -zx tcptrace.dmp'.

    - view the generated plot files with xplot by
      'pathTo/xplot a2b_*.xpl'.  To view just the time-sequence plot,
      use 'pathTo/xplot a2b_tsg.xpl'.

Note: The tcptrace version used is 5.2.1.  Other versions
      may produce different file names.

DESCRIPTION OF THE FILES:-
-------------------------

Note: <scenario> refers to this variant-drop combination,
e.g. the scenario for NewReno 3 packet drop is 'newreno-3drop'

Each subdirectory contains:

Input files:

1. scenario.app
   - specifies the application being used.
2a. scenario-asciidump.config
   - QualNet configuration input file for ascii trace.
2b. scenario-binarydump.config
   - QualNet configuration input file for binary trace.
3. scenario.routes-static
   - specifies static route table used to route packets.

Output files:

4. scenario-asciidump.stat/scenario-binarydump.stat
   - qualnet statistics collection for FTP/GENERIC and TCP.
5. tcptrace.asc
   - tcpdump ascii trace of the simulation.
6. tcptrace.dmp
   - tcpdump binary trace of the simulation.

Processed plot files from tcptrace:

7. a2b_owin.xpl
   - outstanding data from node 1 to node 4
8. a2b_rtt.xpl
   - rtt samples from node 1 to node 4
9. a2b_ssize.xpl
   - segment size from node 1 to node 4
10. a2b_tput.xpl
   - throughput from node 1 to node 4
11. a2b_tsg.xpl
   - time-sequence graph from node 1 to node 4
12 to 16 b2a_*.xpl
   - similar to 7 - 11 from node 4 to node 1
17. a_b_tline.xpl
   - time line plot.
