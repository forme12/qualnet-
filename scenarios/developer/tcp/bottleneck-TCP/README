PURPOSE:-
--------
To show multiple TCP flows share the same bottleneck link.


SCENARIO:-
---------
 1                         5
  \                       /
   \                     /
    \                   /
     3-----------------4
    /                   \
   /                     \
  /                       \
 2                         6

The bottleneck link is the link between node 3 and node 4


APPLICATIONS:-
-------------
Two FTP connections. One from node 1 to node 5 and the other is from
node 2 to node 6. Both of them will go through the link between node 3 and 4

FTP/GENERIC 1 5 60000 960 1.001S 30S PRECEDENCE 0
FTP/GENERIC 2 6 600000 960 1.005S 30S PRECEDENCE 1


RUN:-
----
Run '<QUALNET_HOME>/bin/qualnet bottleneck-TCP.config'

5. bottleneck-TCP.routes-default - File defines the default routes
6. bottleneck-TCP.routes-static - File defines the static routes
7. DEFAULT.png - icon file for the nodes
8. README - This file.
