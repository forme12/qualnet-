PURPOSE:-
--------
To test the occurrence of collision in a subnet(Subnet 0.0) due to two different
nodes have tried to transmit their frames simultaneously. Whereas for subnet 1.0 no
collision exists as a single node forwarding frame for two different
destinations.


SCENARIO:-
---------

            Subnet 0.0                                Subnet 1.0

                                 Link 3.0

CBR is used to send
    15 data segments of 512 bytes from node 7 to node 1 (from 90000000US).
    15 data segments of 512 bytes from node 7 to node 9 (from 90000000US).
    15 data segments of 512 bytes from node 5 to node 6 (from 90000003US).
