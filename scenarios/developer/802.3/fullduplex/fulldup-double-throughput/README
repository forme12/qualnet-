PURPOSE:
-------
To show the performance of FULL-DUPLEX ETHERNET doubles the throughput.

SCENARIO:
---------
In this scenario, there is four CBR sessions.

Node 1 being the source and Node 2 being the destination and vice-versa.
Node 3 being the source and Node 4 being the destination and vice-versa.



All the Subnets have a Data Rate Of 10Mbps

SUBNET 0.0 is in FULL-DUPLEX mode while
SUBNET 1.0 is in HALF-DUPLEX mode.

CBR is used to transfer continuous data segments of 1024 Bytes each at 1 micro second intervals
starting at 5 micro seconds after the simulation till the end.

The throughput of the CBR servers in SUBNET 0.0 is double to that of SUBNET 1.0
