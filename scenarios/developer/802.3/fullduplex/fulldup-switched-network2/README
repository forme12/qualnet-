PURPOSE:
-------
To show the operation of FULL-DUPLEX ETHERNET in a mixed switched network.


SCENARIO:
---------
In this scenario, there is four CBR sessions.

1> Node 5  being the source and Node 7  being the destination
2> Node 7  being the source and Node 5  being the destination
3> Node 8  being the source and Node 13 being the destination
4> Node 13 being the source and Node 8  being the destination

All Subnet Data Rates are 10Mbps.

CBR is used to transfer continuous data segments of 512 Bytes each at 0.01 microsecond intervals
starting at 50S after the simulation till the end.
