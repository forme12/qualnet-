PURPOSE:
-------
To test the transmission and reception of frame in different subnets
with one in Full Duplex transmission mode and the other in Half Duplex,
the nodes being the same in both the subnets


SCENARIO:
---------
In this scenario, there is four CBR sessions.

Node 1 being the source and Node 2 being the destination and vice-versa in 
two subnets.


The Subnet Data Rate is 1 Gbps in both subnets.


            SUBNET N8-1.0   
            |-----------|
            |           |
            1           2
            |           |
            |-----------|
            SUBNET N8-0.0
            
            
The above topology contains 2 subnets containing 2 nodes each. Each of the 
2 nodes in each of the 2 subnets contains 2 interfaces. Here one subnet (SUBNET N8-0.0)
is in Full Duplex mode while the other (SUBNET N8-1.0) is in Half Duplex mode.


CBR is used to transfer continuous data segments of 1024Bytes each at 1 microsecond intervals
starting at 1S after the simulation till the end.
