PURPOSE:
-------
To show the operation of FULL-DUPLEX ETHERNET in a totally switched network.


SCENARIO:
---------
In this scenario, there is four CBR sessions.

Node 1 being the source and Node 4 being the destination and vice-versa.
Node 3 being the source and Node 2 being the destination and vice-versa.


All nodes are connected to the switch by point-to-point Full-Duplex Link 
of bandwidth 1Gbps.

   ---------------        
        1 Gbps

CBR is used to transfer continuous data segments of 1024 Bytes each at 1 microsecond intervals
starting at 50S after the simulation till the end.
