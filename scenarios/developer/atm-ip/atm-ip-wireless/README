PURPOSE:-
--------
Test to check if ATM-IP is working properly when IP-cloud is
completely wireless-network.

SCENARIO:-
---------

1 ..+                      +... 7
    :                      :

2...+                      +....6




3, 4, 5  are  ATM-NODE
3, 5 are ATM-END-SYSTEM

Rest of the nodes are in IP Cloud


CBR is running between two ATM-END-SYSTEM node 3 and 5 and
between node 6 and node 2 in both directions.




RUN:-
----
Run '<QUALNET_HOME>/bin/qualnet atm-ip-wireless.config'.
