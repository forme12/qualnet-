PURPOSE:-
--------
Traffic are generated from source node for destination node, situated in the
same IP-cloud. Similarly traffics are sent from another source node to destination node,
situated in another IP-cloud, separated by ATM-backbone.

SCENARIO:-
---------

--------- means an  ATM link.

3 4 5 6 7 8   are  ATM-NODE
3 7 8 are ATM-END-SYSTEM

Rest of the nodes are in IP Cloud

Traffic are generated from node 1 for destination node 3, situated in the
same IP-cloud. Similarly traffics are sent from node 1 to node 11, situated
in another IP-cloud, separated by ATM-backbone.
