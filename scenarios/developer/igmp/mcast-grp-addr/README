PURPOSE:-
--------

To test Group Address field of IGMP messages conforms to RFC 2236.

"In a Membership Query message, the group address field is set to zero
when sending a General Query, and set to the group address being
queried when sending a Group-Specific Query. In a Membership Report or
Leave Group message, the group address field holds the IP multicast
group address of the group being reported or left."
So a report message should be only received by hosts
which are member of the group for which report has been sent and leave
report should be received by the routers. Group specific query should be
received by the hosts of the group from which leave report has come.
