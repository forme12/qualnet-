# Nodes in QualNet are uniquely identified by a nodeId.  A nodeId can
# range from 1 to 4,294,967,295.
#
# Terminology:  "node 4" means the node with nodeId equal to 4.
# See the notes further below for how IP addresses are assigned.
#

#
# Create a wireless or Ethernet/802.3 network consisting of nodes 1
# through 30.  The MAC-PROTOCOL and PHY-MODEL parameters control the
# type of device specific to the network.  QualNet creates a network
# interface for each node in the network, and IP addresses are auto-
# assigned.
#

#SUBNET N16-0 { 1 thru 30 }


#
# Create three links with this topology:  1 --- 2 --- 3 --- 4.
# Each link is a point-to-point (serial) link between two nodes.  These
# links are dedicated, error-free, and support the maximum bandwidth in
# both directions simultaneously.  QualNet creates two network
# interfaces for each end of a link, and IP addresses are auto-assigned.
#
# Warning:
# If you enable these lines, comment out the SUBNET statement, change
# ROUTING-PROTOCOL to a wired routing protocol, and remove/fix extra
# lines in the applications file (default.app).  You CAN have both
# SUBNET and LINK statements in the same scenario, but you'll have to be
# careful about assigning routing protocols to each network -- see the
# section on "Node qualifiers" later below.

# Restrictions:
# Network addresses must be unique. (different masks don't help!)
# Only one IP address is assigned per interface, and this IP address
# must be unique.  (Multiple 192.168/24 private networks and secondary
# IP addresses are not supported.)
# Nodes possessing multiple interfaces are supported, but care must be
# taken in selecting routing protocols.
#
# N syntax long explanation:
# The number after N is the number of bits used for the hostid;
# 32 minus this number is the number of bits used for the networkid.
# The string following the hyphen is the right-most part of the network
# address, implicitly preceded by zeroes as necessary.
#

#
# Node qualifiers
#
# You can also use the N syntax to restrict parameters to certain
# networks, e.g.,
#
# [N2-2.0] LINK-BANDWIDTH           300
# [N2-2.0] LINK-PROPAGATION-DELAY   500MS
#
# tells QualNet that any links in the N2-2.0 network operate at 300 bps
# with 500 ms propagation delay.  You can use these qualifiers to
# restrict routing protocols to certain networks, and so on.  Within the
# brackets, you can also specify nodeIds and IP addresses; multiple
# values should be separated by spaces.
#
# Instance qualifiers
#
# These qualifiers appear after the parameter name, e.g.,
#
# PROPAGATION-CHANNEL-FREQUENCY[0]  2.4e9
#
# The instance qualifier has a meaning specific to the parameter
# (it's usually NOT a network, nodeId, or IP address).

# The following parameter represents the node placement strategy.
# - UNIFORM:  Based on the number of nodes in the simulation, the physical
#   terrain is divided into a number of cells.  Within each cell, a node is
#   placed randomly.
# - RANDOM:  Nodes are placed randomly within the physical terrain.
# - GRID:  Node placement starts at (0, 0) and are placed in grid format with
#   each node GRID-UNIT away from its neighbors.  The number of nodes has to
#   be a square of an integer.
# - FILE:  Position of nodes is read from NODE-POSITION-FILE.  On each line of
#   the file, the x and y position of a single node is separated by a space.
# - GROUP: Node placement is defined based on groups. See the Group Mobility
#   Model section for more details.

#
# Group Mobility Model
#
# Under the group mobility model, the mobility vector of a node can be viewed
# as sum of two independent mobility vectors, the group mobility vector (Vg)
# and the internal mobility vector (Vi). Mobile nodes in the same group share
# the same mobility vector Vg at any time. Each of them then also has its
# internal group mobility vector Vi within the bound of the group dimensions.
# In the implementation, both the group mobility and the internal mobility
# vectors are modeled independently following the random waypoint mobility
# model. In detail, each group decides its group mobility direction and speed
# randomly. Each node then decides its internal mobility randomly and computes
# its actual mobility by summing the two mobility vectors.
#
# The group mobility model implementation follows the following specificaton:
#
# "A Group Mobility Model for Ad Hoc Wireless Networks"
# by X. Hong, M. Gerla, G. Pei, and C.-C. Chiang
# In Proc of ACM/IEEE MSWiM'99, Seattle, WA, Aug. 1999.
#
# To use group mobility, the following must be specified:
#
# NODE-PLACEMENT   GROUP
#
# Specify the number of groups the scenario will have using:
#
# NUM-MOBILITY-GROUPS    <number of groups>
#
# Example:
#
# NUM-MOBILITY-GROUPS    4
#
# Specify the nodes in each group using:
#
# MOBILITY-GROUP[<group number>] { <nodes> }
#
# Example:
#
# MOBILITY-GROUP[0] {1 thru 25}
# MOBILITY-GROUP[1] {26 thru 50}
# MOBILITY-GROUP[2] {51 thru 75}
# MOBILITY-GROUP[3] {76 thru 100}
#
# Specify the group areas by:
#
# GROUP-AREA[<group number>] <origin> <dimension>
#
# Example:
#
# GROUP-AREA[0] (0, 0) (750, 750)
# GROUP-AREA[1] (750, 0) (750, 750)
# GROUP-AREA[2] (0, 750) (750, 750)
# GROUP-AREA[3] (750, 750) (750, 750)
#
# An alternate definition of group areas is:
#
# GROUP-AREA-ORIGIN[<group number>]    <origin>
# GROUP-AREA-DIMENSION[<group number>] <dimension>
#
# Example:
#
# GROUP-AREA-ORIGIN[0] (0, 0)
# GROUP-AREA-DIMENSION[0] (750, 750)
# GROUP-AREA-ORIGIN[1] (750, 0)
# GROUP-AREA-DIMENSION[1] (750, 750)
# GROUP-AREA-ORIGIN[2] (0, 750)
# GROUP-AREA-DIMENSION[2] (750, 750)
# GROUP-AREA-ORIGIN[3] (750, 750)
# GROUP-AREA-DIMENSION[3] (750, 750)

# For the LATLONALT coordinate system, use the following to influence the group
# movement within a particular region.  These parameters are optional.  If
# not specified, the whole terrain is assumed.
#
# GROUP-TERRAIN-CONSTRAINT-SOUTH-WEST-CORNER[<group number>] <southwest corner>
# GROUP-TERRAIN-CONSTRAINT-NORTH-EAST-CORNER[<group number>] <northeast corner>
#
# Example:
#
# GROUP-TERRAIN-CONSTRAINT-SOUTH-WEST-CORNER[0] (-0.005, -0.005)
# GROUP-TERRAIN-CONSTRAINT-NORTH-EAST-CORNER[0] (0, 0)
#
# For the CARTESIAN coordinate system, use the following to influence the group
# movement within a particular region.  These parameters are optional.  If
# not specified, the whole terrain is assumed.
#
# GROUP-TERRAIN-CONSTRAINT-LOWER-LEFT-CORNER[<group number>] <lower left corner>
# GROUP-TERRAIN-CONSTRAINT-UPPER-RIGHT-CORNER[<group number>] (upper right corner>
#
# Example:
#
# GROUP-TERRAIN-CONSTRAINT-LOWER-LEFT-CORNER[0] (0, 750)
# GROUP-TERRAIN-CONSTRAINT-UPPER-RIGHT-CORNER[0] (750, 1500)
#
# Specify how nodes in each group is initially placed by:
#
# GROUP-NODE-PLACEMENT[<group number>]  RANDOM | UNIFORM | GRID
#
# Example:
#
# GROUP-NODE-PLACEMENT[0]  UNIFORM
# GROUP-NODE-PLACEMENT[1]  UNIFORM
# GROUP-NODE-PLACEMENT[2]  UNIFORM
# GROUP-NODE-PLACEMENT[3]  UNIFORM
#

#
# The following represent parameters for mobility.  If MOBILITY is set to
# NONE, then there is no movement of nodes in the model.
#
# For random waypoint, a node randomly selects a destination from the
# physical terrain.  It moves to the destination at constant speed, chosen
# between MOBILITY-WP-MIN-SPEED and MOBILITY-WP-MAX-SPEED (meters/sec).
# After it reaches its destination, the node stays there for
# MOBILITY-WP-PAUSE time, and the process is repeated (selecting another
# destination and speed).

# This is an abstract model of a satellite network.  Each satellite
# network is group into subnets.  Each satellite subnet has
# exactly one satellite node and many ground nodes.  The
# ground nodes associated with a subnet always transmit to the
# designated subnet satellite node.  Thus, no handoffs are
# involved.  Also, satellite nodes are bent-pipe satellites
# (relay data only).  When the satellite node receives data
# from the ground nodes, it broadcasts the data to all other ground
# nodes in the subnet, but not to the ground node originating the data.
# Finally, the satellite node must not be generating any packets.
# Thus, the satellite node cannot run an application or routing protocol.
#
# Note: SATCOM-PROPAGATION-DELAY specifies ground-to-ground propagation delay.
#
# MAC-PROTOCOL SATCOM

#
# PROMISCUOUS-MODE defaults to YES and is necessary if nodes want

# The TDMA model permits the following parameters. If no parameters

# The MAC Switch model is based on the IEEE 802.1 standards and covers
# Level 2 switches and port based VLANs. MAC 802.3 and LINK are the two
# protocols supported at the switch ports.
#
# For switched networks, multiple LAN segments are permitted within the
# same network address. For example, to specify 3 LAN segments in subnet
# 1.0 and connected to ports of a switch with node id 100, use
#   LINK    N8-1.0 { 100, 1 }
#   LINK    N8-1.0 { 100, 2 }
#   SUBNET  N8-1.0 ( 100, 3 thru 10}
# Note that the N syntax uses a number large enough number for the mask to
# cover all the interfaces of the 1.0 subnet; the LINK does not use N2 as
# would the common practice in non-switch scenarios.

#
# General input
#

# In general, switch inputs are based on switch ID (which maps to node ID).
# [switch ID] SWITCH-SPECIFIC-PARAMETER    <value>
#
# Port inputs have the form
# [switch ID] SWITCH-PORT-SPECIFIC-PARAMETER[port ID]    <value>
# The first form is shown here.
#
# Some port inputs have an additional form based on the port's interface
# address. For example,
# [port address] SWITCH-PORT-SPECIFIC-PARAMETER    <value>
# This form is not generally applicable, and is not illustrated here.

# Specify a node as a switch. Default is NO
# [100] SWITCH      YES | NO

# If port specific parameters would be input, each switch port needs to be
# mapped to an interface address. If no port specific parameters would be
# input for a switch, an AUTO mapping may be used. Default is MANUAL.
# SWITCH-PORT-MAPPING-TYPE    AUTO | MANUAL

# Map each switch port to an interface address. Here, port 2 of switch 100
# has the interface address 1.3. This mapping is required if
# SWITCH-PORT-MAPPING-TYPE is of type MANUAL, the default.
# [100] SWITCH-PORT-MAP[2]    1.3


# Maximum number of dynamic entries of the filtering / learning
# database. Default value is 500.
# [switch ID] SWITCH-DATABASE-MAX-ENTRIES    500

# Ageing time for dynamic entries in the filtering/learning database.
# Default is 300 seconds, range is 10 to 1000000 seconds.
# [switch ID] SWITCH-DATABASE-AGING-TIME    300S


# The queue values at each switch port can be individually configured.
# The queue type is FIFO, scheduling is always Strict Priority.

# Number of output queues. Default is 3, range is 1 to 8.
# [switch ID] SWITCH-QUEUE-NUM-PRIORITIES[port ID]    3

# Size of output queues. Default is 150000.
# [switch ID] SWITCH-OUTPUT-QUEUE-SIZE[port ID]    150000

# Size of input queue. Default is 150000.

# Size of CPU queue. Default is 640000.
# [switch ID] SWITCH-CPU-QUEUE-SIZE    640000

# Throughput of backplane. Default is 0 bps, which implies that there
# will be no backplane delay.
# [switch ID] SWITCH-BACKPLANE-THROUGHPUT    0

#
# STP input
#

# The implementation follows the single rapid spanning tree of 802.1w.
# In general, the default values are appropriate. For root election, use
# SWITCH-PRIORITY.

# Run the spanning tree protocol. Default is YES.
# Ensure that if NO is used, the switched network is loop free.
# [switch ID] SWITCH-RUN-STP    NO | YES

# Priority of a switch. Default is 32768. Range is 0 to 61440. If the
# value is not a multiple of 4096, the nearest multiple is used. Note that
# a lower value of priority is better, 0 is the highest priority.
# [switch ID] SWITCH-PRIORITY    32768

# Hello time for STP. This is time between generation of BPDUs by the root
# switch. Default is 2 seconds. Range is 1 to 10 seconds.
# [switch ID] SWITCH-HELLO-TIME    2S

# Max age time for BPDUs. Default is 20 seconds, range is 6 to 40 seconds

# bandwidth of the protocol connnected to the port, resulting in values
# ranging from 1 to 200000000
# [switch ID] SWITCH-PORT-PATH-COST[port ID]    <value>

# Port priority. Default is 128, range is 0 to 240. If the input value is
# not a multiple of 16, the nearest value is used. Note that a lower value
# of priority is better, 0 is the highest priority.
# [switch ID] SWITCH-PORT-PATH-PRIORITY[port ID]    128

# Port is attached to a point-to-point link. Default is AUTO, implying
# true if the switch port is given in a LINK statement. Other options are

# [switch ID] SWITCH-PORT-POINT-TO-POINT[port ID] AUTO

# Port is the only switch port in a switched network attached to a LAN.
# Default is NO.
# [2] SWITCH-PORT-EDGE[port ID]    NO | YES

#
# VLAN input
#

# The implementation supports port-based VLANs based on 802.1q.
#
# Segments with the same VLAN ID should be given the same subnet address
# and mask. Segments with different VLAN IDs should have different subnet
# addresses for inter-VLAN communication and require routing.
#
#   LINK    N8-1.0 { 100, 1 }
#   LINK    N8-2.0 { 100, 2 }
#   LINK    N8-1.0 { 200, 21 }
#   LINK    N8-2.0 { 200, 22 }
#   LINK    N8-3.0 { 100, 200 }
#
# In the example, nodes 100 and 200 are switches. End-stations 1 and 21 are
# in the same VLAN, and 2 and 22 are in a different VLAN. The subnet address
# of the inter-switch link is not relevant.
#
# Range of VLAN IDs is 1 (the default) to 4090.

# Switch supports VLANs. Default is NO.
# [100] SWITCH-VLAN-AWARE    YES

# VLAN ID and tagging for end stations. By default, end-stations do not
# send VLAN tagged frames and the VLAN ID is not specified.
# [end station address list] SWITCH-STATION-VLAN-ID    <VLAN ID>
# [end station address list] SWITCH-STATION-VLAN-TAGGING    YES

# VLAN ID for a switch port. If not specified, the default is 1.
# For an access link, this is typically the value of the VLAN ID of the
# end stations attached to the port. For trunk links, this is typically
# the default VLAN ID and does not need to be input. For hybrid segments,
# the value is typically that of the untagged end stations.
# [switch ID] SWITCH-PORT-VLAN-ID[port ID]    <VLAN ID>

# Types of frames allowed at ingress to a port. Default is ALL. If TAGGED
# option is used, the port will filter untagged frames.
# [switch ID] SWITCH-PORT-VLAN-ADMIT-FRAMES[port ID] ALL | TAGGED

# Ingress filter based on member set. Default is NONE.
# [node] SWITCH-PORT-VLAN-INGRESS-FILTERING[port ID] NONE | VLAN

# Member set for each VLAN at a switch. There is no default.
# The member set for a VLAN is the set of ports across which broadcasts for
# that VLAN are flooded. The untagged set is a subset of the member set
# where egress frames are not tagged.
# [switch ID] SWITCH-VLAN-MEMBER-SET[VLAN ID] <port number list> | ALL
# [switch ID] SWITCH-VLAN-UNTAGGED-MEMBER-SET[VLAN ID] <port set> | ALL

# VLAN learning type for a switch database. Default is SHARED.
# For SHARED learning, there is one database for all the VLANs.
# For INDEPENDENT learning, there is one database per VLAN.
# For COMBINED learning, there is an m:n relation between VLANs and
# databases. This requires additional input.
# [switch node] SWITCH-VLAN-LEARNING    SHARED | INDEPENDENT | COMBINED

# VLAN to database mapping for COMBINED learning. VLAN mappings that are
# not specified map to filter database ID 1. Range of fid (filter database
# ID) ranges from 2 to 4090.
# [switch ID] SWITCH-VLAN-COMBINED-LEARNING[fid] <vlanIdList>

#
# GVRP/GARP
#

# GVRP is a convenient mechanism to dynamically create the VLAN member
# sets in a switched network. The implementation is based on IEEE 802.1q
# for GVRP and 802.1d for GARP. Note that the GARP applicant/registrar state
# machines apply only to switch ports; end-stations do not participate in
# the dynamic application and registration process in the implementation.
#
# If GVRP is enabled, it suffices to set the port VLAN ID for access links.
# Note that GVRP does not create the untagged member set.

# Switch uses GVRP. Applicable only to VLAN aware switches.
# Default is NO.
# SWITCH-RUN-GVRP YES

# Size GVRP for maximum number of VLANS. Default is 10. Range is 1 to 4090.
# SWITCH-GVRP-MAXIMUM-VLANS 10

# GARP join time. Specifies the average time between Join messages sent
# by the applicant. Default is 200 milliseconds.
# SWITCH-GARP-JOIN-TIME 200MS

# GARP leave time. Specifies the time a registrar takes to transition
# from In state to Empty state. Default is 600 milliseconds. The leave
# time should be thrice join time.
# SWITCH-GARP-LEAVE-TIME 600MS

# GARP leave-all time. Specifies the periodic interval between LeaveAll
# messages. Default is 10 seconds. This value should be at least 10 times
# the leave time.
# SWITCH-GARP-LEAVEALL-TIME 10S


#
# Switch statistics
#

# Additional switch statistics require that MAC-LAYER-STATISTICS be YES.

# Print of switch database statistics. Default is NO.
# [switch ID] SWITCH-DATABASE-STATISTICS YES | NO

# Print of port specific statistics. Default is NO.
# [switch ID] SWITCH-PORT-STATISTICS[port ID] YES | NO

# Print of scheduler specific statistics at each port. Default is NO.

#
# Below are examples of how to specify vendor router models described

#
# The number of separate priority queues is specified below, QualNet
# currently generates three types, CONTROL, REAL_TIME, and NON_REAL_TIME,
# so "3" is a good minimum value.  If you specify less than "3", the
# lower priority packets will be placed in the lowest-priority queue that
# exists.  Specifying less than "1" is an error condition due to the
# inability of that node to store any packets at the IP layer.
#

IP-QUEUE-NUM-PRIORITIES   3

#
# The following parameter specifies the size of each of the
# "priority queues", the number of which is specified by
# IP-QUEUE-NUM-PRIORITIES.  If there are 3 "priority queues", each
# will have a byte-capacity equal to the value of
# IP-QUEUE-PRIORITY-QUEUE-SIZE specified below.
#
# You can also specify each priority queue's size separately, using the
# Instance ID [] after the parameter name, as in an example below.  Make sure
# that you use Instance ID's numbering from
# { 0, ..., (IP-QUEUE-NUM-PRIORITIES-1) }
#
# You can also use Node and Network Specific Parameterization with brackets

#
# Example: All nodes have a FIFO queue for priority 2
#          IP-QUEUE-TYPE[2] FIFO
#
#IP-QUEUE-TYPE [0] FIFO
#IP-QUEUE-TYPE [1] RIO

# RED represents Random Early Detection(Drop) as presented in
#      Sally Floyd and Van Jacobson,
#      "Random Early Detection For Congestion Avoidance",
#      IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking, August 1993.
#      This implementation drops packets, it does not mark them.
#
# RED requires the following additional parameters:
#
#      RED-MIN-THRESHOLD : the number of packets in the queue that represents
#                          the lower bound at which packets can be randomly
#                          dropped.
#      RED-MAX-THRESHOLD : the number of packets in the queue that represents
#                          the upper bound at which packets can be randomly
#                          dropped.
#      RED-MAX-PROBABILITY : the maximum probability (0...1) at which a
#                            packet can be dropped (before the queue is
#                            completely full, of course).
#      RED-QUEUE-WEIGHT : the queue weight determines bias towards recent
#                         or historical queue lengths in calculating the
#                         average.
#      RED-SMALL-PACKET-TRANSMISSION-TIME : a sample amount of time that it
#                                           would take to transmit a small
#                                           packet - used to estimate the
#                                           queue average during idle periods.

# RIO represents Random Early Detection(Drop)with In/Out Bit.  It is a
# variant of RED. It can operate in both two or three color modes.
#
# In two color mode it use twin RED algorithms:
# - the first for the Green profile packets and
# - the second for Yellow profile packets
#
# In three color mode it uses three RED algorithms:
# - the first for the Green profile packets and
# - the second for Yellow profile packets and
# - the third for Red profile packets.
#
# It operates either in coupled or decoupled mode.
#
# Coupled mode counts Green profile packets towards the drop calculation
# for Yellow profile packets, while Decoupled mode counts them separately.
#
# Use the GREEN- YELLOW- and RED- THRESHOLD and PROBABILITY parameters
# to specify thresholds and probabilities for each queue.

#
# ECN represents Explicit Congestion Notification as presented in
# Sally Floyd and K. Ramakrishnan, RFC 2481,
# "A Proposal to add Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) to IP."
# ECN marks the IP header instead of dropping packets when the network
# queue gets congested.
#
# ECN requires one of the IP-QUEUE-TYPE (RED, RIO, or WRED).
# Furthermore, the source and destination nodes must be ECN
# enabled; intermediate routes may or may not be ECN enabled.
# By default, ECN is disabled.  Only TCP is able to interpret
# the ECN-marked packets.
#
# Example: To enable ECN, do the following:
#ECN         YES
#

#
# The "STRICT-PRIORITY" scheduler for IP indicates that all packets of
# a higher priority are sent before any packets for a lower priority.
#
# The "WEIGHTED-FAIR" scheduler implements Weighted Fair Queueing with
# the highest priority queue getting a weight which is higher than that
# of all the other queues by default.  Users can also specify the queue
# weight for each of the priority queues (but must specify the weight for
# all of them) by specifying "QUEUE-WEIGHT[priority] <value>" where value
# is the desired weight for that priority queue.
#
# The "SELF-CLOCKED-FAIR" scheduler implements Self Clocked Fair Queueing.
# It is a variant "WEIGHTED-FAIR" scheduler.  To specify the queue weights
# manually, use the QUEUE-WEIGHT[priority] parameter as above.
#
# The "ROUND-ROBIN" scheduler cycles from the first priority queue to
# the last, pulling a single packet from each
#
# The "WEIGHTED-ROUND-ROBIN" scheduler accepts weights for each priority
# queue, and services packets in round-robin fashion, giving more "turns"
# to queues with higher weights.  To specify the queue weights manually,
# use the QUEUE-WEIGHT[priority] parameter as above.
#
# The "CBQ" (Class-Based Queueing) Scheduler is configured via three
# parameters:
#     "LINK-SHARING-STRUCTURE-FILE"
#         The Link Sharing Structure File contains configuration
#         information about weights, priorities, and link sharing
#         between agencies.
#     "CBQ-GENERAL-SCHEDULER" specifies the packet scheduler that CBQ
#         uses to manage the queues.
#     "CBQ-LINK-SHARING-GUIDELINE" determines whether or not bandwidth
#         is regulated by the link sharing scheduler.  Bandwidth remains
#         unregulated in the "Ancestor-Only" case when the class of
#         traffic is under-limit, or its immediate ancestor is under-limit.
#         Bandwidth remains unregulated in the "Top-Level" case when the
#         class of traffic is under-limit, or at least one of its ancestors
#         up to CBQ-TOP-LEVEL generations above, are under-limit.
#     "CBQ-TOP-LEVEL" determines the maximum number of generations to
#         search, for under-limit ancestors.
#
# The highest priority is numbered "0", and the lowest priority is "n-1",
# where n = IP-QUEUE-NUM-PRIORITIES

# The "DIFFSERV-ENABLED" scheduler for IP is the combination of two

#          Note: When peer does not respond with the Sack Permitted option,
#                SACK reverts to LITE behavior.
#
# TCP    TAHOE | RENO | LITE | NEWRENO | SACK

#
# Value of maximum segment size.
# If not specified, default is 512
# TCP-MSS                                512

#
# QualNet supports the following TCP traces.  Only one trace
# type can be used at a time during the entire simulation.
#
# TCPDUMP:  A tcpdump compatible binary format.
#           Trace output file is tcptrace.dmp.  This trace file can
#           be used with the tcptrace (http://www.tcptrace.org/index.html)
#           Unix utility program.
#
#           Note: The machine type (big or little endian)
#                 must also be specified in tcp.c with the default being
#                 little endian.  To specify big endian, comment out
#                 "#define LITTLE_ENDIAN" in tcp.cpp and recompile QualNet.
#
# TCPDUMP-ASCII:  A tcpdump compatible ascii format.
#                 Trace output file is tcptrace.asc
#
# By default, QualNet does not generate a TCP trace file.
# To generate one, use the following:
#
# TCP-TRACE TCPDUMP | TCPDUMP-ASCII
#

#
# Additionally, the direction of the trace can be specified with the following:
#
# BOTH:   Trace both input and output packets.
# OUTPUT: Trace only packets output to the network.
# INPUT:  Trace only packets received from the network.
#
# By default, the direction is set to BOTH.
#
# Note: The user should note that while there is flexibility
#       in specifying any combination of directions, it may not
#       satisfy the needs of tcptrace analysis.
#       The graphical output, especially the rtt plot, may not
#       show up in some combinations.  An example is input from
#       one node and output from the node across the connnection.
#       In most instances, specifying the direction as BOTH is suitable.
#
#
# TCP-TRACE-DIRECTION  BOTH | OUTPUT | INPUT
#

#
# Example: To get a TCPDUMP trace for node 1, do the following:
#
# [1] TCP-TRACE                 TCPDUMP
# [1] TCP-TRACE-DIRECTION       BOTH
#
# Next, use 'tcptrace -G tcptrace.dmp' to get all the xplot files.
# Then, use 'xplot <file>' to view the xplot files.
