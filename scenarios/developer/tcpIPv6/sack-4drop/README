PURPOSE:-
-------
To show the behavior of the Sack in the presence of 4 packet drops.

The network protocol is IPv6.


SCENARIO:-
---------
In the scenario, there is one TCP session, with node 1 being the source
and node 4 being the destination.


        s1 (Node 1)
         \
 10Mb,5ms \          0.8Mb,100ms
           r1 (Node 3)--------- k1 (Node 4)
 10Mb,5ms /
         /
        s2 (Node 2)


APPLICATIONS:-
-------------
FTP/GENERIC is used to transfer data segments of 1000B starting from 1
second to the end of simulation(i.e 6 seconds) between Node 1 and 4


RUN:-
----
Run '<QUALNET_HOME>/bin/qualnet sack-4drop.config'


DESCRIPTION OF THE FILES:-
-------------------------


Input files:

1. sack-4drop.app
   - QualNet configuration file for application input.
2a. sack-4drop-asciidump.config
   - QualNet configuration input file for ascii trace.
2b. sack-4drop-binarydump.config
   - QualNet configuration input file for binary trace.
3. sack-4drop.routes-static
   - specifies static route table used to route packets.

Output files:

4. sack-4drop-asciidump.stat/sack-4drop-binarydump.stat
   - QualNet statistics collection for FTP/GENERIC and TCP.
5. tcptrace.asc
   - tcpdump ascii trace of the simulation.
6. tcptrace.dmp
