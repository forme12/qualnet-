PURPOSE:-
--------
To compare RED and FIFO performance (average queue length, throughput
through a bottleneck link) in scenarios that are similar to the ones
described in Figures 5, and 6 of:

    S. Floyd and V. Jacobson, "Random Early Detection Gateways for
    Congestion Avoidance," IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking,
    1(4), August 1993.


NOTES:-
------
There are differences in the statistics collected by these scenarios
in Linux, versus those in Sun SPARC Solaris and Intel Windows NT/2000/XP.
These differences, are not related to the architecture (Because Sun SPARC
Solaris results match Intel Windows results), but rather to the method
that floating point calculations are implemented in Linux.  We have included
a separate set of expected statistic files for Linux, described in the list
of files below.


SCENARIO:-
---------
There are two FTP sources (nodes 3 and 4) that produce 1000-byte
(960 bytes of data + 40 bytes of TCP header) packets as quickly
as TCP can send them, destined for node 1, which is connected
only to node 2 by a 45 Mbps bottleneck link.  Nodes 3 and 4 are
connected to node 2 by separate 100 Mbps links.

            |-------- 3
1 ------- 2 | 100Mbps
            |
  45Mbps    |-------- 4
              100Mbps

We use the TCP-NO-DELAY-ACKS option to instruct the destination
node 1 to send ACKs immediately upon receiving the data packets.

We have changed the TCP maximum segment size to 1000 bytes with
the TCP-MSS option.

We use the TCP-USE-RFC1323 option to enable window scaling (the
maximum window size without this option is 65536 bytes)

We specify TCP send and receive buffers of size 240,000 bytes with
the TCP-SEND-BUFFER and TCP-RECEIVE-BUFFER options.
