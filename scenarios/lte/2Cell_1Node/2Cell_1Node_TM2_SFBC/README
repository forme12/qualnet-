PURPOSE:-
-------
To test SFBC(Space-Frequency Block Coding) data transfer for LTE network.

SCENARIO:-
---------
One subnet is present in the scenario, having one Serving
Gateway/Mobility Management Entity (SGW/MME), two base stations (eNodeB)
and two user equipments (UE). Node 5 is SGW/MME, Nodes 3, 4 are UE. 
Nodes 1, 2 are eNodeB.

TOPOLOGY:
---------

                  5(SGW/MME)
                       |
                      HUB
                     /   \
                    /     \
                   /       \
            1(eNodeB)     2(eNodeB)



            3(UE)            4(UE)


CBR flows ares:

- CBR 3 4 0 512 0.1S 1S 10S PRECEDENCE 0 
- CBR 4 3 0 512 0.1S 1S 10S PRECEDENCE 0 


No fading model is being used in the scenario.

RUN:-
----
Run '<QUALNET_HOME>/bin/qualnet 2Cell_1Node.TM2.SFBC.config'.
