PURPOSE:-
-------
To test the case of multiple target eNBs.
To confirm if UEs choose appropreate eNB.

SCENARIO:-
---------
One LTE subnet is present in the scenario, having three base stations (eNodeBs) 
and seven user equipments (UEs). Nodes 100 - 106 are UEs. Node 2, 3 and 4 are eNodeBs.
eNB1 is using ch0,1. eNB2 is using ch4,5. eNB3 is using ch2,3.

RUN:-
----
Run '<QUALNET_HOME>/bin/qualnet multiple_target_eNBs_inter_ch_2.config'.


DESCRIPTION OF THE FILES:-
------------------------
1.multiple_target_eNBs_inter_ch_2.config - QualNet configuration input file.
2.multiple_target_eNBs_inter_ch_2.app    - QualNet configuration file for application input.
3.multiple_target_eNBs_inter_ch_2.nodes  - QualNet node placement file for the simulation run.
  UE's mobility pattern is described in this file.
4.multiple_target_eNBs_inter_ch_2.expected.stat - QualNet statistics collection.
6.UL_BER_MCS*.ber - Bit error rate table for various MCS(modulation, coding systems) for Uplink.
7.DL_BER_MCS*.ber - Bit error rate table for various MCS(modulation, coding systems) for Downlink.
8.README - This file

EXPECTED RESULTS:
----------------
All the UEs must select nearer eNB and success to HO.
All the application packets will be transfered between UEs and CN.
