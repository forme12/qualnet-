PURPOSE:-
-------
To test OLSM(Open Loop Spatial Multiplexing) data transfer for LTE network.

SCENARIO:-
---------
One subnet is present in the scenario, having one Serving Gateway/Mobility
Management Entity (SGW/MME), one base station (eNodeB) and one user
equipment (UE). Node 3 is SGW/MME. Node 2 is UE. Node 1 is eNodeB.

TOPOLOGY:
---------

           3(SGW/MME)
                |
               HUB
                |
            1(eNodeB)            2(UE)


CBR flows ares:

- CBR 1 2 0 512 0.1S 1S 10S PRECEDENCE 0 
- CBR 2 1 0 512 0.1S 1S 10S PRECEDENCE 0 

No fading model is being used in the scenario.

RUN:-
----
Run '<QUALNET_HOME>/bin/qualnet 1Cell_1Node.TM3.OLSM.config'.
