PURPOSE:-
-------
To test attaching a UE to an eNB after the UE was once detatched 
from another eNB.

SCENARIO:-
---------
One subnet is present in the scenario, having two base stations (eNodeB), 
one user equipment (UE), one Serving Gateway/Mobility Management Entity 
(SGW/MME) and a Corresponding Node (CN). Node 4 is UE. Node 2 and 3 are
eNodeB. Node 1 is SGW/MME. Node 6 is CN. The UE once goes outside the 
coverd area of Node2 and goes inside the area of Node3.

TOPOLOGY:
---------


 6(CN)     1(SGWMME)     2(eNodeB)       4(UE)
               
                         3(eNodeB)


CBR flows ares:

- CBR 4 6 0 512 10MS 2S 8S PRECEDENCE 0
- CBR 6 4 0 512 10MS 2S 8S PRECEDENCE 0

No fading model is being used in the scenario.

RUN:-
----
Run '<QUALNET_HOME>/bin/qualnet detach_and_attach_3.config'.


DESCRIPTION OF THE FILES:-
------------------------
1.detach_and_attach_3.config - QualNet configuration input file.
2.detach_and_attach_3.app    - QualNet configuration file for application input.
3.detach_and_attach_3.nodes  - QualNet node placement file for the simulation run.
4.detach_and_attach_3.expected.stat - QualNet statistics collection.
6.UL_BER_MCS*.ber - Bit error rate table for various MCS(modulation, coding systems) for Uplink.
7.DL_BER_MCS*.ber - Bit error rate table for various MCS(modulation, coding systems) for Downlink.
