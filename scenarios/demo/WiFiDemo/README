PURPOSE:
---------
This demo scenario is refereed in product tour to demonstrate how to create and run a simple wireless/wired 
combined scenario in 2D/3D GUI, and analyze the performance.




SCENARIO:
----------

       7-------------------------HUB-----------------------8
       |                                                   |
       |                                                   |
       1 (BaseStation1)                                    2 (BaseStation2)
      
     3(MS1)   4(MS2)                                    5(MS3) 6(MS4)
     
In this scenario, 2 WiFi access points and 4 WiFi mobile terminals are deployed.  
Mobile terminal (MS1) moves from the area covered by access point 1 (BaseStation1) to the area covered 
by access point 2 (BaseStation2) and then return to the area covered by access point 1(BaseStation1). 
There is One CBR traffic from MS1 to MS3. When MS1 moves, association/reassociation and handover are 
happened between the two APs.
