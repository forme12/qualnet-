PURPOSE:-
--------
To verify the fix done for bug#5864.


SCENARIO:-
---------
NODES: 4
node-2 is client, node-4 server.
MAC protocol - ALOHA 



Topology:-
---------
                                       
             (3)-------|             |--------(5)

               (4)-----|             |---------(6)      
     

Nodes - 1,3&4 are in one subnet.
Nodes - 2,5&6 are in second subnet.

MAC protocol ALOHA for single point-to-point wireless link
between nodes-1 and 2.                        

CBR is used to send data segments from
Node-2 to Node-1
Node-3 to Node-5
Node-4 to Node-6
