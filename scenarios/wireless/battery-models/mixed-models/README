To verify all supported battery models.




SCENARIO:-
---------

Name:battery-mixed-model
There is Octagon  topology with one node at each corner (1 thru 8) and one node(9) at the center.
The following battery models have been configured:
[ 1 thru 3 ] BATTERY-MODEL LINEAR
[ 1 thru 3 ] BATTERY-INITIAL-CHARGE 400

[ 4 ] BATTERY-MODEL NONE

[ 5 thru 7 ] BATTERY-MODEL RESIDUAL-LIFE-ACCURATE
[ 5 thru 7 ] BATTERY-TYPE DURACELL-AA-MX-1500
[ 5 thru 7 ] BATTERY-LOAD-UTILITY-TABLE-FILE duracell-mx1500.utl

[ 8 9 ] BATTERY-MODEL SERVICE-LIFE-ACCURATE
[ 8 9 ] BATTERY-TYPE DURACELL-AA
[ 8 9 ] BATTERY-PRECOMPUTE-TABLE-FILE duracell-aa.pcm



The node at the center(node 9) relays higher traffic than the other node; hence it expects to dissipate energy higher than the other nodes and has shorter lifetime.
All nodes have 802.11b wireless connections.
The energy is consumed as specified follows:
[ 1 thru 9 ] ENERGY-MODEL-SPECIFICATION USER-DEFINED
[ 1 thru 9 ] ENERGY-TX-CURRENT-LOAD 220.0
[ 1 thru 9 ] ENERGY-RX-CURRENT-LOAD 200.0
[ 1 thru 9 ] ENERGY-IDLE-CURRENT-LOAD 100.0
[ 1 thru 9 ] ENERGY-SLEEP-CURRENT-LOAD 0.0
[ 1 thru 9 ] ENERGY-OPERATIONAL-VOLTAGE 3.0
Routing protocol is AODV.



RUN:-
----
Run "<QUALNET_HOME>/bin/qualnet battery-mixed-model.config".
