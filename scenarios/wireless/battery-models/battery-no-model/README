PURPOSE:-
--------
To the case that no battery model is configured for the nodes in the network.
Cumulative consumed charge is printed in the stat file for when no battery model is selected




SCENARIO:-
---------

Name:battery-no-model
There is Octagon  topology with one node at each corner (1 thru 8) and one node(9) at the center.

All nodes are configured with battery model as NONE.


The node at the center(node 9) relays higher traffic than the other node; hence it expects to dissipate energy higher than the other nodes and has shorter lifetime.
All nodes have 802.11b wireless connections.
The energy is consumed as specified follows:

[ 1 thru 9 ] ENERGY-MODEL-SPECIFICATION USER-DEFINED
[ 1 thru 9 ] ENERGY-TX-CURRENT-LOAD 220.0
[ 1 thru 9 ] ENERGY-RX-CURRENT-LOAD 200.0
[ 1 thru 9 ] ENERGY-IDLE-CURRENT-LOAD 150.0
[ 1 thru 9 ] ENERGY-SLEEP-CURRENT-LOAD 0.0
[ 1 thru 9 ] ENERGY-OPERATIONAL-VOLTAGE 3.0


Routing protocol is AODV.



RUN:-
----
Run "<QUALNET_HOME>/bin/qualnet battery-no-model.config".


DESCRIPTION OF THE FILES:-
-------------------------
1. README                            - this file.
2. battery-no-model.config           - general configuration.
3. battery-no-model.app              - application configuration.
4. battery-no-model.nodes            - node positions.
5. battery-no-model.expected.stat    - expected output statistics.
