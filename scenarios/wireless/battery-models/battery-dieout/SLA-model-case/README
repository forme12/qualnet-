PURPOSE:-
--------
To verify Service Life Accurate(SLA) battery model with the battery type configured as ITSY battery type.
Data sheet of this battery type is included in the scenario folder.




SCENARIO:-
---------

Name:battery-SLA-model
There is Octagon  topology with one node at each corner (1 thru 8) and one node(9) at the center.
All the nodes in this scenario are battery-operated devices and are configured with Service Life Accurate(SLA) model. 
The battery type is ITSY.
The battery has been configured as SERVICE-LIFE-ACCURATE which in fact models the charge recovery effect in batteries means that if a battery 
sleeps for a while it recovers some amount of its lost charge then it can wake up to resume charging the system. 



The node at the center(node 9) relays higher traffic than the other node; hence it expects to dissipate energy higher than the other nodes and has shorter lifetime.
All nodes have 802.11b wireless connections.
The energy is consumed as specified follows:
[ 1 thru 9 ] ENERGY-MODEL-SPECIFICATION USER-DEFINED
[ 1 thru 9 ] ENERGY-TX-CURRENT-LOAD 20.0
[ 1 thru 9 ] ENERGY-RX-CURRENT-LOAD 15.0
[ 1 thru 9 ] ENERGY-IDLE-CURRENT-LOAD 10.0
[ 1 thru 9 ] ENERGY-SLEEP-CURRENT-LOAD 0.0
[ 1 thru 9 ] ENERGY-OPERATIONAL-VOLTAGE 3.0
Routing protocol is AODV.



RUN:-
----
Run "<QUALNET_HOME>/bin/qualnet battery-SLA-model.config".
