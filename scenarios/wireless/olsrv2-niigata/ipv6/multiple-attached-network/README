PURPOSE:-
--------
To test the OLSR-NIIGATA functionality for multiple Non-OLSRv2 networks using an 
IPv6 scenario.



SCENARIO:-
---------
       
              
                               [1]        [2]
                                |          |
                                |          |
                             [Wireless subnet1]
                                     |
                                     |
                                    [3]
                                  /     \
                                /         \
                [Wireless subnet2]       [Wireless subnet3]
                  |          |               |          |
                  |          |               |          |
                 [4]        [5]             [6]        [7]

  
                             
Nodes 1, 2 and 3 are in one Wireless subnet running OLSRv2-NIIGATA as routing
protocol. Nodes 3, 4 and 5 are in second wireless subnet running OSPFv2 as routing
protocol(i.e. Non-OLSRv2 domain) and Nodes 3, 6, 7 are in third wireless subnet 
running some other routing protocol. Here Node 3 is connected to two Non-OLSRv2
networks.


Application:
------------
Two CBR applications are configured from Node 1 to 5 and Node 2 to 6.



RUN:-
----
Run '<QUALNET_HOME>/bin/qualnet multiple-attached-network.config'.


DESCRIPTION OF THE FILES:-
-------------------------
1. multiple-attached-network.app           - QualNet configuration file for application 
                                             input.
2. multiple-attached-network.config        - QualNet configuration input file.
3. multiple-attached-network.expected.stat - QualNet statistics collection.
4. multiple-attached-network.nodes         - QualNet Configuration file for node position 
                                             input.
5. README                                  - This file.
