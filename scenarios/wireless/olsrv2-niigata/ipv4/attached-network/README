PURPOSE:-
--------
To test for proper learning of the attached networks present with an OLSRv2 
network in an IPv4 scenario.

Nodes 1, 2 and 3 are placed in a wireless subnet running OLSRv2-NIIGATA as 
routing protocol. Nodes 6, 7 and 8 are placed in other wireless subnet configured
as Non-OLSRv2 domain. Nodes 3 to 4, 4 to 5 and 5 to 6 are connected through 
wireless point to point links.
Nodes 4 and 5 are also running OLSRv2-NIIGATA as routing protocol.


Application:
------------
Three CBR applications are as:
From Node 1 to Node 7
From Node 2 to Node 8 and 
From Node 3 to Node 6.



RUN:-
----
Run '<QUALNET_HOME>/bin/qualnet attached-network.config'.


DESCRIPTION OF THE FILES:-
-------------------------
1. attached-network.app           - QualNet configuration file for application 
                                    input.
2. attached-network.config        - QualNet configuration input file.
3. attached-network.expected.stat - QualNet statistics collection.
4. attached-network.nodes         - QualNet Configuration file for node position
                                    input.
5. README                         - This file.
