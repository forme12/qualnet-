                     Final Topology
                     
                     

Nodes 1 thru 7 are in Ad-hoc network.All the nodes are running
OLSRv2-NIIGATA as routing protocol. Node 4 is configured with 
mobility.Initially for some time node 4 is in the range of nodes 
1, 2 and 3, then after some time node 4 moves out of the range of 
nodes 1, 2 and 3 and comes in the range of nodes 5, 6 and 7.

Two CBR applications are configured between Nodes 2 and 3 and Nodes
5 and 7. 
Initially for the first 60 sec node 4 is in the range of Nodes 2 
and 3 for this interval application packets from node 2 to 3 will 
be sent through node 4. Then after 60 sec node 4 will move out of 
range and will come in the range of nodes 5 and 7, then the 
application packets from node 5 to 7 will be sent through node 4.
