PURPOSE:-
--------
To show the use of DEM terrain files.


SCENARIO:-
---------
                         28 (satellite)
                                               {25 - 27}
                              {21 - 24}
             1 --- 2 --- 3
   4
{5 - 20}

Node 4, 21, 25, 28 are in the same SATCOM subnet with node 28 as the
  satellite nodes
Node 5 to 27 are in the same wireless subnet running MACDOT11
Node 1 connects to node 2 via wireless point to point link
Node 2 connects to node 3 via wireless point to point link

Node 1, 2, and 3 moves from left bottom to right top
