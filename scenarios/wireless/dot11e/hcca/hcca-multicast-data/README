PURPOSE:-
--------
To test how QualNet dot11e model handles multicast data.



SCENARIO:-
---------

          
     
         [1]                   [2] 
           \                   /
             \               /
               \           /
                 \       /
                   \   /
    [6]- - - - - - -  - - - - - - - -[3]               
                    / \
                  /     \
                /         \
              /             \
            /                 \
          [5]                [4]

      
   
             
    


All nodes are QSTAs. 
Node 1 is HC/QAP.
QSTAs  2 joins multicast group 225.0.0.1 at 5S and leaves the group at 25S.
QSTAs  3 joins multicast group 225.0.0.1 at 5S and leaves the group at 28S.
QSTAs  4 joins multicast group 225.0.0.1 at 4S and leaves the group at 22S.

Node 2 is sending 100 CBR packets with PRECEDENCE 5 to Node 6.
Node 5 is sending 100 MCBR packets to muticast group 225.0.0.1.
