PURPOSE:-
--------
To test how Dot11e (MAC 802.11e) protocol operates in various priority traffics 
in QIBSS mode



SCENARIO:-
---------

                 
         2(QSTA)           5(QSTA)
               
                   1(QAP)      
          
        3(QSTA)            4(QSTA)



Node 1 is QAP and 2., 3, 4, & 5 are QSTAs

Node 3 is sending CBR packets with PRECEDENCE 1 to 1 in the interval of 0.01 Sec's
Node 3 is sending CBR packets with PRECEDENCE 3 to 4 in the interval of 0.01 Sec's
Node 2 is sending CBR packets with PRECEDENCE 6 to 5 in the interval of 0.01 Sec's

Note: Number of priorities is set to 8 in the configuration

RUN:-
----
Run "<QUALNET_HOME>/bin/qualnet dot11e-traffic-load.config".
