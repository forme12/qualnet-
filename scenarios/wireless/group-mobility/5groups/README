PURPOSE:-
--------
Test the GROUP mobility model.

SCENARIO:-
---------
Totally, 5 groups are defined.
Group 0: From node 1 to node 40. This group is static.
         Its nodes scattered in the whole field.
         Its nodes are represented by gray rectangle in canvas.
Group 1: From node 41 to node 50. This is a fast moving
         group with speed between 40 m/s to 60 m/s
         Its nodes are represented by green circles.
Group 2: From node 51 to node 60. This is also a fast
         moving group with speed between 20m/s to 40m/s
         Its nodes are represented by red circles.
Group 3: From node 61 to node 70. This is a middle-speed
         moving group with speed between 10 m/s to 20 m/s
         Its nodes are represented by blue circles.
Group 4: From node 71 to node 80. This is a slow-moving
         group with speed between 1 m/s to 10 m/s.
         Its nodes are represented by yellow circles.

Two CBR flows are defined as the applications.
CBR 30 49 0 512 1S  1S 0S
CBR 1  76 0 512 1S  2.05S 0S


RUN:-
