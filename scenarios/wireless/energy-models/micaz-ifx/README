PURPOSE:-
--------
To verify micaZ energy model for the radio interface.
All the nodes in this scenario are battery-operated devices and are configured by simple linear battery model.
The radio interfaces for all nodes are configured with MicaZ therefore energy is consumed 
by those interfaces according to the energy specification  of micaZ(included in the Energy Model reference lib document)



SCENARIO:-
---------

Name:micaz-ifx

There is Losang topology with one node at each corner(1,3,4,5) and one node at the center(2).
The node at the center(2) relays higher traffic than the other node; hence it expects to dissipate energy higher than the other nodes and has shorter lifetime.
All nodes have 802.11b wireless connections. 
Routing protocol is AODV. 

RUN:-
----
Run "<QUALNET_HOME>/bin/qualnet micaz-ifx.config".


DESCRIPTION OF THE FILES:-
-------------------------
1. README                   - this file.
2. micaz-ifx.config           - general configuration.
3. micaz-ifx.app              - application configuration.
4. micaz-ifx.nodes            - node positions.
5. micaz-ifx.expected.stat    - expected output statistics.
