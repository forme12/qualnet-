PURPOSE:-
--------
To verify USER-DEFINED energy model for the radio interface.




SCENARIO:-
---------

Name:user-defined-ifx

There is Losang topology with one node at each corner(1,3,4,5) and one node at the center(2).
The node at the center(2) relays higher traffic than the other node; hence it expects to dissipate energy higher than the other nodes and has shorter lifetime.
All nodes have 802.11b wireless connections. 
Routing protocol is AODV. 
All the nodes in this scenario are battery-operated devices and are configured by simple linear battery model.

The radio interfaces for all nodes are user-defined configured as follows:

[ 1 thru 3 ] ENERGY-MODEL-SPECIFICATION USER-DEFINED
[ 1 thru 3 ] ENERGY-TX-CURRENT-LOAD 220.0
[ 1 thru 3 ] ENERGY-RX-CURRENT-LOAD 200.0
[ 1 thru 3 ] ENERGY-IDLE-CURRENT-LOAD 150.0
[ 1 thru 3 ] ENERGY-SLEEP-CURRENT-LOAD 0.0
[ 1 thru 3 ] ENERGY-OPERATIONAL-VOLTAGE 3.0

[ 4 ] ENERGY-MODEL-SPECIFICATION USER-DEFINED
[ 4 ] ENERGY-TX-CURRENT-LOAD 20.0
[ 4 ] ENERGY-RX-CURRENT-LOAD 15.0
[ 4 ] ENERGY-IDLE-CURRENT-LOAD 10.0
[ 4 ] ENERGY-SLEEP-CURRENT-LOAD 0.0
[ 4 ] ENERGY-OPERATIONAL-VOLTAGE 3.0

[ 5 ] ENERGY-MODEL-SPECIFICATION MICAZ


Hence, energy consumed for receive/transmit/idle/sleep by those interfaces according to the above-defined energy specifications.
