PURPOSE:-
--------
To check whether the new introduced antenna (ANTENNA-MODEL
PATTERNED) behaves properly in accordance with the 2D pattern
file format(ASCII2D) with PHY ABSTRACT Model.

SCENARIO:-

There are three nodes in the scenario. Node 1 is having a PATTERNED antenna.
Gain in the direction of node 3 is negative while in the direction of 
node 2 is positive. Both the node (2 and 3) initiate the application (CBR) to
Node 1. But the application from node 3 to node 1 fails due to insufficient 
gain.


------- means a wireless link
