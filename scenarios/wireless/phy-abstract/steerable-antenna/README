PURPOSE:-
--------
To check whether the new introduced antenna (ANTENNA-MODEL
STEERABLE) behaves properly in accordance with the 2D pattern
file format(ASCII2D).

SCENARIO:-

There are four nodes in the scenario. Node 1 is having a STEERABLE antenna.
Node 2 , 3 and 4 are placed in at different angle from node 1.
All the node (2 ,3 and 4) initiate the application (CBR) to Node 1. pattern at
node 1 has a beamwidth of 5 degrees. Antenna at node 1 steers itself to 
receive packet from all the nodes (2  3 and 4) respectively.


------- means a wireless link
