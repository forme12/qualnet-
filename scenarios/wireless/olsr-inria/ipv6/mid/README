PURPOSE:-
--------
To test the functionality of mid implementation for the computation 
of MID Table in an IPv6 scenario


SCENARIO:-
---------

                             [9]
     
    

Nodes 1, 2 and 3 are in wired subnet connected through a switch,
nodes 3, 4 & 5 and nodes 6, 7 & 9 are in two wireless subnets. 
All the three subnets are running OLSR as routing protocol.
Nodes 3 and 7 are connected through wireless point to point link.
Both nodes 3 and 7 are having multiple interfaces. 


Application:
------------
CBR application is configured between Node 5 and Node 7.


RUN:-
----
Run '<QUALNET_HOME>/bin/qualnet mid.config'.


DESCRIPTION OF THE FILES:-
-------------------------
1. mid.app           - QualNet configuration file for application input.
2. mid.config        - QualNet configuration input file.
3. mid.expected.stat - QualNet statistics collection.
4. mid.nodes         - QualNet configuration file for node position input.
5. README            - This file.
