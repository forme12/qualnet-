Nodes 1 thru 4 and Nodes 5 thru 7  are in two wireless subnets.
Node 4 and 5 are also connected in third wireless subnet.All 
the subnets are running OLSR as routing protocol.

Application:
------------
Two CBR applications are configured between:
Node 1 and Node 5
Node 6 and Node 2



RUN:-
----
Run '<QUALNET_HOME>/bin/qualnet mpr-selector.config'.
