Nodes 1, 2 and 3 belong to a wireless subnet running OSPFv2(i.e.
Non-OLSR domain) as routing protocol.Nodes 4, 5 and 6 are in other
wireless subnet running OLSR-INRIA as routing protocol. Node 1
has two interfaces one is configured for OSPFv2 routing protocol 
and other is configured for OLSR-INRIA routing protocol as shown in 
figure.

Application:
------------
CBR session is configured between Node 6 and Node 2. 


RUN:-
----
