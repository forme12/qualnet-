PURPOSE:-
--------
To test the OLSR implementation for v6-v4-v6 type tunneling.



SCENARIO:-
---------
                      
    [1]                                                  [7]
     |                                                    | 
                                                         
     |                                                    | 
  [Wireless]- - -[3]- - - -[5]- - - -[4]- - - -[8]- - -[Wireless] 
  [Subnet  ]                                           [Subnet  ]
     |                                                    |
                                                         
     |                                                    |
    [2]                                                  [9]                    
    
    
    
    

Nodes 1, 2 and 3 belong to a wireless subnet and Nodes 7, 8 and 9
belongs to another wireless subnet. Both the subnets are running 
OLSR as routing protocol and are configured as IPv6 networks.
Nodes 3, 4, 5 and 8 are connected through wireless links, running 
RIP as routing protocol and are configured to be in IPv4 network.
And a v4 tunnel is configured from node 3 to node 8.

Application:
------------
CBR sessions are configured between:
Node 1 and Node 9 
Node 7 and Node 2 



RUN:-
----
Run '<QUALNET_HOME>/bin/qualnet v6o-v4rip-v6o.config'.


DESCRIPTION OF THE FILES:-
-------------------------
1. v6o-v4rip-v6o.app           - QualNet configuration file for application input.
2. v6o-v4rip-v6o.config        - QualNet configuration input file.
3. v6o-v4rip-v6o.tunnel        - QualNet configuration file for tunnel input.
3. v6o-v4rip-v6o.expected.stat - QualNet statistics collection.
4. v6o-v4rip-v6o.nodes         - QualNet configuration file for node position input.
7. README                      - This file.
