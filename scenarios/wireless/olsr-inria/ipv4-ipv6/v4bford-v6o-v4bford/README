PURPOSE:-
--------
To test the OLSR implementation for v4-v6-v4 type tunneling.



SCENARIO:-
---------

                      
       [1]                                                  [7]
        |                                                    | 
                                                            
        |                                                    | 
     [Wireless]- - -[3]- - - -[5]- - - -[4]- - - -[8]- - -[Wireless] 
     [Subnet  ]                                           [Subnet  ]
        |                                                    |
                                                            
        |                                                    |
       [2]                                                  [9]             
    
    
    

Nodes 1, 2 and 3 belong to a wireless subnet and Nodes 7, 8 and 9
belongs to another wireless subnet. Both the subnets are running 
BELLMANFORD as routing protocol and are configured as IPv4 networks.
Nodes 3, 4, 5 and 8 are connected through wireless links, running 
OLSR as routing protocol and are configured to be in IPv6 network.
And a v6 tunnel is configured from node 3 to node 8.

Application:
------------
CBR sessions are configured between:
Node 1 and Node 9 
Node 7 and Node 2


RUN:-
----
Run '<QUALNET_HOME>/bin/qualnet v4bford-v6o-v4bford.config'.


DESCRIPTION OF THE FILES:-
-------------------------
1. v4bford-v6o-v4bford.app           - QualNet configuration file for application input.
2. v4bford-v6o-v4bford.config        - QualNet configuration input file.
3. v4bford-v6o-v4bford.tunnel        - QualNet configuration file for tunnel input.
