PURPOSE:-
--------
To test the OLSR implementation for v6-v4-v6 type tunneling.


SCENARIO:-
---------
                      
      [1]                                                  [7]
       |                                                    |

  [Subnet  ]                                           [Subnet  ]
       |                                                    |
                                                             
       |                                                    |
      [2]                                                  [9]      
    
    
    

Nodes 1, 2 and 3 belong to a wireless subnet and Nodes 7, 8 and 9
belongs to another wireless subnet. Both the subnets are running 
RIPng as routing protocol and are configured as IPv6 networks.
Nodes 3, 4, 5 and 8 are connected through wireless links, running 
OLSR as routing protocol and are configured to be in IPv4 network.
and a v4 tunnel is configured from node 3 to node 8.

Application:
------------
CBR sessions are configured between:
Node 1 and Node 9 
Node 7 and Node 2 


RUN:-
----
Run '<QUALNET_HOME>/bin/qualnet v6ripng-v4o-v6ripng.config'.


DESCRIPTION OF THE FILES:-
-------------------------
1. v6ripng-v4o-v6ripng.app           - QualNet configuration file for application input.
