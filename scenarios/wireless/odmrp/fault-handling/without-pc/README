PURPOSE:-
--------
To see how program behaves if a node failure occurs in a time-interval
during communication.


SCENARIO:-
---------
                 / 2 \
               1   |   4
                 \ 3 /

     Node 1 sends data to node 4.
     Solid line shows connection between nodes (i.e. they are within radio
     range of each other).
     Failure at node 2 occurs within a time slot during communication.


APPLICATIONS:-
------------

  MCBR 1 225.0.0.0 30 512 2S 0S 50S


RUN:-
----
Run '<QUALNET_HOME>/bin/qualnet fault.config'


DESCRIPTION OF THE FILES:-
-------------------------
1. fault.app -  QualNet configuration file for application input.
2. fault.config - QualNet configuration input file.
3. fault.expected.stat - QualNet statistics collection.
4. fault.member  - Group Member File
5. fault.node  - QualNet Node Placement file
6. fault.fault   - Qualnet Interface Fault file
7. fault.routes-default- QualNet default route file
