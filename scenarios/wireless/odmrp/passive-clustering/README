/* With PASSIVE CLUSTERING enabled  */

PURPOSE:
-------
Passive clustering form stable cluster. It uses first declaration win rule.
This means that a node which first declare itself as Cluster Head cannot
be overwritten by another node.

(Requires PASSIVE_CLUSTERING to be enabled.)


SCENARIO:
---------

            2                       5
            |                       |
            1  -->                  4
                                    |
                                    3

     Here, node 1 is sending data to multicast group in which the member is
     only node 2. Similarly, node 5 is sending data to node 3.
     Node 1 is moving towards node 4 (shown by arrow).
