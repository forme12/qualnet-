PURPOSE:-
--------
To test the functionality of AODV when dualIP is enabled on 
different interfaces of a node.


SCENARIO:-
---------
                    4            
                    |            
                    |            
                    |            
            1 - - - 2 - - - -3
                    |             
                    |             
                    |   
                    5             
Nodes 1,2 and 2, 3 are connected with each other with IPv6 Link.
Nodes 2, 4 and 2, 5 are connected with each other with IPv4 Link.
All the nodes are Dual IP enabled and routing protocol is set to AODV.

APPLICATIONS:-
-------------
Nodes 1 is sending CBR packets to Node 3 
Nodes 4 is sending CBR packets to Node 5


RUN:-
----
Run '<QUALNET_HOME>/bin/qualnet dualip.config'.


DESCRIPTION OF THE FILES:-
-------------------------
1. dualip.nodes - QualNet configuration file for node placement.
2. dualip.config - QualNet configuration input file.
3. dualip.app - QualNet Application configuration file.
4. dualip.expected.stat - QualNet statistics collection.
5. dualip..routes-static  - QualNet static routes file
6. dualip.routes-default - QualNet default routes specification file
7. README - This file.
