PURPOSE:-
--------
Test RERR generation and forwarding.



SCENARIO:-
---------

--------- means a normal link.
----X---- means a broken link

1-----2--X--3-----4-----5
      |
      |
      6


Node 1 sends 1 packet to Node 5, and Node 6 sends 1 packet to Node 4
before the link breaks.  Node 1 sends 1 packet to Node 4 after the link
breaks.  Node 2 generates RERR. This reaches to Node 1 & Node 6 and will
take appropriate action on receiving the RERR.
