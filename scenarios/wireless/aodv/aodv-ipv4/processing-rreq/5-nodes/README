Node1 sends 1 packet to Node 5.  Node 4 gets two RREQs but rejects one of
them.

     - RREQ is rebroadcast with ttl incremented by TTL_INCREMENT (Node 1)
     - An expired routing table entry SHOULD NOT be expunged before current
       time + DELETE_PERIOD
     - RREQ is not forwarded if TTL expires (Node 2, 3 do not forward
       request with TTL=1)
     - RREQ is forwarded using broadcast mechanism and not unicast
     - Node can eliminate duplicate RREQ receipt (Node 4)
