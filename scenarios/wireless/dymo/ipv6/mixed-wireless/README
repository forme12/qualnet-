PURPOSE:-
--------
To show activities of DYMO under mixed wireless scenario.


SCENARIO:-
---------

-------- means a wireless link


-------
|     |
|     | means a wireless subnet where the nodes are directly reachable
|     |

  SLA-0

Application CBR is used to send 100 data packets of 512 bytes from node 1 to node 9.Application start time is 70S and end time is 600S. 
Node 1 (Source node) has no route for the target node 9 so it generate RREQ Routing Message and broadcast it with the TTL value of 1. 
This RREQ message is dropped at the intermediate node 2,3,4,5,6,7,8 and 9 because of TTL value is zero. Again, source node will 
broadcast RREQ message with the TTL value of 3. Now, after processing RREQ message,intermediate node will forward this RREQ message to 
its neighbor.Now node 4 will forward this RREQ message with TTL value of 2 to subnet.Similarly, at each intermediate node value of TTL 
is decremented by one and if the node is not the target it will forward the RREQ routing message is forwarded. 
At node 9 which is the target node generate Route Reply (RREP) routing message.This RREP message is unicasted to next hop. 
When source node 1 receive this RREP routing message then route is established between source and target node.


Note :- In this scenario MOBILITY of nodes is NONE.
