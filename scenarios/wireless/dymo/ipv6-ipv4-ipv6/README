PURPOSE:-
--------
Test dual-ip (ipv6-ipv4-ipv6) behavior.



SCENARIO:-
---------

-------- means a wireless link

-------
|     |
|     | means a wireless subnet where the nodes are directly reachable
|     |
-------

 Subnet-1              Subnet-2              Subnet-3
-------------         -----------          -------------
|  1     2  |         | 6    7  |          | 13    12 |

SLA-0                 N8-192.0.1.0             SLA-2

There are two applications between source node and destination node. Both Applications are CBR.Which is used to send 100 data packets of
512 bytes from node 1 to node 14 and node 13 to node 5.Both applications start time is 1S.Source node will continuously send the data packets to the target 
node till the end of simulation time is not reached.
Subnet1 is IPV6, subnet2 is IPV4 and subnet 3 is again IPV6.
Node 3 and Node 8 are dual IP nodes. IPV4 tunnel is used to send data packet of IPV6 network in both directions.
Node 1 (Source node) has no route for the target node 14 so it generate RREQ Routing Message and broadcast it with the TTL value of 1.
Similarly, node 13 also generate RREQ routing message for the target node 5.This RREQ message is dropped at the intermediate node 2, 5, 4 
and 3 because TTL value is zero after preprocessing of routing message. Source node will again retried RREQ message with the TTL value of 
3. Now, after processing RREQ message, intermediate node 2,5,4 and 3 will forward this RREQ message to its neighboring nodes with TTL 
value 2. At node 3, this is dual IP node use tunnel to forward the control packets with TTL value 2. When the source node and the other 
nodes receive the same RREQ message again then this RREQ message is count as duplicate RREQ message so it is discarded. Nodes 6, 7, 9 ,
10 and 8 will forward this RREQ message with TTL value 1.Now, the target node 14 will receive this RREQ message and generating RREP 
routing message which in unicasted toward next hop which is node 8 dual IP node. After travelling,hop by hop distance when source node 1
receives this RREP routing message through dual IP node 3 then route is established between source and the target node.
Same procedure is repeated for the application between node 13 and node 5.



Note :- In this scenario MOBILITY of nodes is NONE.
