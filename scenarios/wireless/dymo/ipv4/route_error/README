PURPOSE:-
--------
To Test Route Error (RERR) generation and processing by intermediate node and source node.



SCENARIO:-
---------

--------- means a link.
----X---- means a broken link

INITILAL TOPOLOGY:-

1-----2-----3------4
     
FINAL TOPOLOGY:-

Two Applications are established between nodes 1 and 4 and between node 4 and 1. Both Application CBR is used to send 100 data packets 
of 512 bytes from node 1 to node 4.Application start time is 1S.Source node will continuously send the data packets to the target node 
till the end of simulation time is not reached.
Node 1 (Source node) has no route for the target node 4 so it generate RREQ Routing Message and broadcast it with the TTL value of 1. 
This RREQ message is dropped at the intermediate node 2 because of TTL value is zero after preprocessing of routing message. Source node 
will again retried RREQ message with the TTL value of 3. Now, after processing RREQ message, intermediate node 2 will forward this RREQ 
message to its neighbor 1 and 3 with TTL 2. At node 3 , this RREQ message is count as duplicate RREQ message so it is discarded and node
3 will forward this RREQ message with TTL value 1 .Target node 4 receive this RREQ message ,since this is the target so it generate the 
Route Reply (RREP) routing message. This RREP message is unicasted to next hop. After traveling ,hop by hop distance when source node 
1 receives this RREP routing message then route is established between source and the target node.
When node 1 will send data packets to the target node 4 then all 100 packets will reach the target node successfully. But when the node 4
, which is source node in second application will send the data packet to its target node 1 then few data packets will be dropped  
because Node 2 is mobile so after sometime it is outside the range of node 1.Route is break so RERR is generated by node 2 and by node 1.
After some time node 2 again come back in the range of other node so again route is established between intermediate node and source 
node and packet will reach the target successfully.



Note :- In this scenario node 2 is mobile.
