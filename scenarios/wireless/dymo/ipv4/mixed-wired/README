PURPOSE:-
--------
To show activities of DYMO under mixed wired scenario.


SCENARIO:-
---------

---- means a wired link

                   8
                    
                    
Application CBR is used to send 100 data packets of 512 bytes from node 1 to node 8.Application start time is 1S. 
Each packet duration is 1S.Source node will continuously send the data packets to the target node till the end of simulation time is 
not reached.
Node 1 (Source node) has no route for the target node 8 so it generate RREQ Routing Message and broadcast it with the TTL value of 1. 
This RREQ message is dropped at the intermediate node 2 and 3 because of TTL value is zero. Again, source node will broadcast RREQ 
message with the TTL value of 3. Now, after processing RREQ message,intermediate node will forward this RREQ message to its neighbor.
Now node 4 will this RREQ message with TTL value of 2 to node 6.Similarly, node 6 will forward this routing message to node 7 with TTL
value of 1.At node 7 value of TTL is zero so RREQ message is dropped.Again, node 1 (Source node) will retried RREQ by setting TTL value
5. Now following the same procedure TTL is decremented at each intermediate node and RREQ routing message is forwarded. At node 8,which
is the target node generate Route Reply (RREP) routing message.This RREP message is unicasted to next hop. When source node 1 receive 
this RREP routing message then route is established between source and target node.



Note :- In this scenario MOBILITY of nodes is NONE.
