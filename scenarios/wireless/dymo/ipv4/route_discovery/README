PURPOSE:-
--------
Test Route Request(RREQ)Routing message behavior by intermediate and source node.



SCENARIO:-
---------

--------- means a wireless link.


1-----2-----3------4


Application CBR is used to send 100 data packets of 512 bytes from node 1 to node 4.Application start time is 1S.Node 1 will send 100 
packets to Node 6.Each packet Duration is 1S.Source node will continuously send the data packets to the target node till the end of 
simulation time is not reached.
Node 1 (Source node) has no route for the target node 4 so it generate RREQ Routing Message and broadcast it with the TTL value of 1. 
This RREQ message is dropped at the intermediate node 2 because of TTL value is zero after preprocessing of routing message.Source node 
will again retried RREQ message with the TTL value of 3. Now, after processing RREQ message,intermediate node 2 will forward this RREQ 
message to its neighbor 1 and 3 with TTL 2. At node 3 , this RREQ message is count as duplicate RREQ message so it is discarded and node
3 will forward this RREQ message with TTL value 1 .Target node 4receive this RREQ message ,since this is the target so it generate the 
Route Reply (RREP) routing message.This RREP message is unicasted to next hop.After travelling ,hop by hop distance when source node 
1 receive this RREP routing message then route is established between source and the target node.





Note :- In this scenario MOBILITY of nodes is NONE.
