PURPOSE:-
--------
Test gateway behavior in DYMO Routing Protocol.



SCENARIO:-
---------

--------- means a wireless link.

-----------
|        |
|        |    means a wireless subnet.
|        |
----------

_________ means a static route.

----------

In the above topology, node 1,2 and 3 are connected through a wireless subnet. Nodes 4, 5 and 6 are connected through wired link 
(Static Route).Gateway Nodes are 2 and 3.
Application CBR is established between Node 1 and Node 6.Application start time is 1S. Node 1 will send 100 packets to Node 6.Each packet 
Duration is 1S.Source node will continuously send the data packets to the target node till the end of simulation time is not reached.
Node 1 (Source node) has no route for the target node 6 so it generate RREQ Routing Message. Node 2 and 3 are Gateway which reply RREQ 
routing message by generating Route Reply (RREP) Routing Message. Each intermediate node creates an entry for gateway node in its 
routing table. Route is established between node 1 to node 6 through gateway, so node1 1 will send data packets to gateway which 
forward it to its next hop.


Note :- In this scenario MOBILITY of nodes is NONE.
