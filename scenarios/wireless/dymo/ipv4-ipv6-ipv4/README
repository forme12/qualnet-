PURPOSE:-
--------
Test dual-ip (ipv4-ipv6-ipv4) behavior under DYMO routing protocol.

There are two applications between source node and destination node. Application 1, CBR is used to send 100 data packets of 512 bytes 
from node 1 to node 12 and second Application,FTP/Generic is used to send 1000 items of 512 byte from node 12 to 1. Both applications 
start time is 1S. Source node will continuously send the data packets to the target node till the end of simulation time is not reached.
Subnet1 is IPV4, subnet2 is IPV6 and subnet 3 is again IPV4.
Node 3 and Node 8 are dualip nodes. IPV6 tunnel is used to send data packet of IPV4 network in both directions.
Node 1 (Source node) has no route for the target node 12 so it generate RREQ Routing Message and broadcast it with the TTL value of 1. 
This RREQ message is dropped at the intermediate node 2,5,4 and 3 because TTL value is zero after preprocessing of routing message.
Source node will again retried RREQ message with the TTL value of 3. Now, after processing RREQ message, intermediate node 2,5,4and 3 
will forward this RREQ message to its neighboring nodes with TTL value 2. At node 3, which is dual IP node use tunnel to forward the 
control packets with TTL value 2. When the source node and the other nodes receive the same RREQ message again this RREQ message is count as duplicate
RREQ so it is discarded. Nodes 6, 7, 9 and 8 will forward this RREQ message with TTL value 1.Now, the target node 12 will receive this RREQ
message and generating RREP routing message which in unicasted toward next hop which in node 8 dual IP node. After travelling,hop by hop 
distance when source node 1 receives this RREP routing message through dual IP node 3 then route is established between source and the 
target node.


Note :- In this scenario MOBILITY of nodes is NONE.
