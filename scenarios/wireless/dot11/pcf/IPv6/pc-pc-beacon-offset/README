PURPOSE:-
--------
To test the functionality of WLAN for overlapping PCs
with a delay between their beacon start time (offset of
start of CFPs).


SCENARIO:-
---------
Nodes 1 thru 5 are connected in one wireless subnet.
Nodes 6 thru 9 are connected in another wireless subnet.
Node 1 and 6 are configured as AP/PC.

Both PCs are within each other's receive range. To prevent overlapping
the start time of CFP for node 10 is offset by 180 TUs (1 TU = 1024 microseconds).



Other PCF values are set at default.


       1 (PC)            6 (PC)
   2        4       7
                5              8
       3                 9

CBR  session is configured between
Node 2 and 3 
Node 2 and 5 
Node 3 and 9



RUN:-
----
Run '<QUALNET_HOME>/bin/qualnet pc-pc-beacon-offset.config'.



DESCRIPTION OF THE FILES:-
-------------------------
1. pc-pc-beacon-offset.app -  QualNet configuration file for application input.
2. pc-pc-beacon-offset.config - QualNet configuration input file.
3. pc-pc-beacon-offset.nodes - QualNet node placement file for the simulation run.
4. pc-pc-beacon-offset.expected.stat - QualNet statistics collection.
