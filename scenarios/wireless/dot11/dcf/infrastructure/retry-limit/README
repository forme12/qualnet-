PURPOSE:-
--------
To Test Transmit Limit Functionality for MAC DOT11 model in infrastructure mode.

SCENARIO:-
---------
Eight nodes are placed in a wireless subnet.
Node 1 is configured as AP.
Nodes 2 to 8 are configured as BSS stations.


TOPOLOGY:
--------

              2     3    4

             5     1      6   

                7        8



Application:
------------
CBR session is configured between Node 2 and Node 6. 


Scenario consists of two config files.
For retry-limit.config short packet transmit limit is set to 1 
and for retry-limit1.config short packet transmit limit is set to 7.

For retry-limit.config, short packet transmit limit is 1 hence some of the packets drops.
For retry-limit.config,all the packets reaches at destination.


RUN:-
----
Run '<QUALNET_HOME>/bin/qualnet retry-limit.config'.
Run '<QUALNET_HOME>/bin/qualnet retry-limit1.config'.

DESCRIPTION OF THE FILES:-
-------------------------
1. retry-limit.app -  QualNet configuration file for application input.
2. retry-limit.config - QualNet configuration input file with short packet transmit limit 1.
3. retry-limit1.config - QualNet configuration input file with short packet transmit limit 7. 
4. retry-limit.nodes - QualNet node placement file for the simulation run.
5. retry-limit.expected.stat - QualNet statistics collection.
6. retry-limit1.expected.stat - QualNet statistics collection.
7. README - This file.
