PURPOSE:-
--------
To Test rts-cts procedure for MAC DOT11 model.

SCENARIO:-
---------
Eight nodes are placed in a wireless subnet.
Node 1 is configured as AP.
Nodes 2 to 8 are configured as BSS stations.


TOPOLOGY:
--------


              2     3    4

             5     1      6   

                7        8

Application:
------------
CBR Application is configured between nodes 2 and 6.


Scenario consists of two config files.
For rts-cts.config RTS threshold is set to 600
and for rts-cts1.config RTS threshold is set to 0.

For rts-cts.config RTS threshold is greater than the packet size, hence no 
RTS/CTS are initiated.
For rts-cts1.config RTS threshold is smaller than the packet size,hence 
RTS/CTS are initiated.


RUN:-
----
Run '<QUALNET_HOME>/bin/qualnet rts-cts.config'.
Run '<QUALNET_HOME>/bin/qualnet rts-cts1.config'.


DESCRIPTION OF THE FILES:-
-------------------------
1. rts-cts.app -  QualNet configuration file for application input.
2. rts-cts.config - QualNet configuration input file with RTS Threshold 600.
3. rts-cts1.config - QualNet configuration input file with RTS Threshold 0. 
4. rts-cts.nodes - QualNet node placement file for the simulation run.
5. rts-cts.expected.stat - QualNet statistics collection.
6. rts-cts1.expected.stat - QualNet statistics collection.
7. README - This file.
