PURPOSE:-
--------
To test 802.11  PS Mode model implementation in Infrastructure mode when two BSS are present in Scenario.


SCENARIO:-
---------

Here, 2 wireless subnets are present in Scenario.
Node 1 thru 5 are in one Wireless Subnet.
Node 6 thru 8 are in other Wireless Subnet. 
Node 1 and 2 are AP.


STA 2 is sending CBR packets to Node 9 starting at 2S.
STA 3 is sending CBR packets to Node 4 starting at 2S.

RUN:-
----
Run "<QUALNET_HOME>/bin/qualnet two-bss.config".
