PURPOSE:-
--------
To test 802.11 PS Mode implementation when PS mode is enabled at some nodes and disabled at other node.




SCENARIO:-
---------

Node 1 thru 8 are STAs.
Node 1 is AP. PS mode is enabled at STAs 2, 3, 4 and 5.

Node 2 is sending CBR packet to 6 starting at 2s
Node 8 is sending CBR packet to 3 starting at 2s

RUN:-
----
Run "<QUALNET_HOME>/bin/qualnet ps-nonps.config".
