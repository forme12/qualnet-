PURPOSE:
---------
To demonstrate the PATHLOSS-MATRIX propagation model used in wireless settings.


SCENARIO:
----------

THere are 6 nodes in the scenario. Nodes 1, 2 and 3 are in one wireless subnet 
using one channel, Nodes 4, 5, 6 are in another wireless subnet using another channel.

The propagation model PATHLOSS-MATRIX is used for both channels.


APPLICATIONS:
--------------
CBR 2 3 500 512 1S 20S 0S


RUN:
-----
Run '<QUALNET_HOME>/bin/qualnet pathloss2.config'
