PURPOSE:
---------
To demonstrate the PATHLOSS-MATRIX propagation model used in mobile settings.


SCENARIO:
----------

1 ---------- 3 ---------- 2

Only three nodes in the scenario. Node 1 and node 3 are in one wireless subnet 
using one channel, Node 3 and Node 2 are in another wireless subnet using another channel.
Node 3  moves away from node 1 and toward node 2. 

The propagation model PATHLOSS-MATRIX is used for both channels.


APPLICATIONS:
--------------
CBR 1 2 1000 512 1S 1S 0S PRECEDENCE 0


RUN:
-----
Run '<QUALNET_HOME>/bin/qualnet pathloss1.config'


DESCRIPTION OF THE FILES:
--------------------------
1. pathloss1.app - QualNet configuration file for application input.
2. pathloss1.config - QualNet configuration input file.
3. pathloss1.expected.stat - QualNet statistics collection.
4. pathloss1.nodes - QualNet node position file.
5. pathloss1.dat - QualNet pathloss data (The raw pathloss data is obtained by using Two-Ray model).
6. pathloss1.routes-static - QualNet static routes file. 
7. README - This file.
