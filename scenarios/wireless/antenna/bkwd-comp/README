--------
To check whether the antenna model has backward compatibility i.e, steerable,switchedbeam and
omnidirectional antennas work fine if user tries to initialize them by mentioning them in the
default.config file.




SCENARIO:-

SUBNET N16-0 { 1 thru 8 }

ANTENNA-MODEL   SWITCHED-BEAM
ANTENNA-AZIMUTH-PATTERN-FILE    default.antenna-azimuth

RUN:-
----
Run '<QUALNET_HOME>/bin/qualnet default.config'.


DESCRIPTION OF THE FILES:-
-------------------------
1. default.app -  QualNet configuration file for application input.
2. default.config - QualNet configuration input file.
3. default.expected.stat - QualNet statistics collection.
4. default.antenna-azimuth- QualNet antenna pattern file for azimuth gains
                            in traditional format.
5. default.antenna-models-  QualNet antenna file where all the antenna
                            models are defined.
