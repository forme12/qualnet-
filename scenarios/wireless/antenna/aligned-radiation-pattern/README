PURPOSE:-
--------
To check whether the new introduced antenna (ANTENNA-MODEL-TYPE
PATTERNED) behaves properly in accordance with the 3D pattern
file format(ASCII3D).


SCENARIO:-

SUBNET N16-0 { 1 thru 2 }
ANTENNA-MODEL  ASCII3D-EXAMPLE-PATTERNED

Initial radiation pattern of the nodes at time = 0S
     _                         _
    /  \                      / \
   /    \                    /   \
  |      |                  |     |
   \    /                    \   /
     1                         2
     /\                        /\
     \/                        \/

Final radiation pattern of the nodes at time = 100S
