PURPOSE:-
--------

Illustrate a mesh network as a wireless inter-connect
between non-wireless subnetworks. 

SCENARIO:-
---------

Name: Wireless-link

The mesh has two points of inter-connectivity with
wired subnets and forms a wireless link between them.

Besides the two portals, the mesh consists of 10 MPs
that are mobile using random way-point movement.

Application traffic is a mix of CBR and FTP/Generic  
between wired nodes.

Routing protocol is BellmanFord.
