PURPOSE:-
--------

An arrangement to illustrate inter-networking between
a mesh and wired nodes using Layer 3 connectivity.

SCENARIO:-
---------

Name: Inter-network

The mesh is connected via node 10 to other subnets. 
Node 10 is configured as a portal.

Application traffic is a mix of CBR and FTP/Generic 
between MPs and wired nodes.

Routing protocol is NONE for the mesh.
Routing protocol is OSPFv2 for the portal and wired nodes.
