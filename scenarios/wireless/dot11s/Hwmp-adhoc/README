PURPOSE:-
--------

A 6 mesh point rectangular grid illustrates multi-hop
behavior using layer-2 HWMP on-demand/ad-hoc mode
routing.


SCENARIO:-
---------

Name: Hwmp-adhoc

6 Mesh Points are arranged approximately as in a grid.
The placement of MPs is such that traffic source-
destination is 3 hops distant. Nodes 50, 60 are slightly 
skewed.

Application traffic is a mix of CBR and FTP/Generic 
between MPs at the corner of the grid.

Routing protocol is None.

 
     10 MP ......... 20 MP ......... 30 MP
