PURPOSE:-
--------

A mesh scenario configured with an HWMP root MP.
The root facilitates creation of pro-active roots
by periodic announcements. MPs may use the resulting
tree to forward packets while waiting for on-demand
routes to be discovered.


SCENARIO:-
---------

Name: Hwmp-proactive


An arrangement of MPs, MAPs and stations. Node 10 is 
configured as the HWMP root.

Application traffic is a mix of CBR and FTP/Generic 
between station to station and station to MP.

Routing protocol is NONE.
