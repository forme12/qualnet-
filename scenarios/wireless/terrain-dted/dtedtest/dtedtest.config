# ************* MAC Protocol ***********

MAC-PROTOCOL TDMA
# TDMA slot duration must be greater than or equal to 1MS and less than or equal to 1S. The default value is 10MS. This duration should be longer enough so that a packet can be transmitted.
TDMA-SLOT-DURATION 100MS
TDMA-GUARD-TIME 0NS
TDMA-INTER-FRAME-TIME 1US
TDMA-SCHEDULING AUTOMATIC
# By default, if no TDMA schedule is given, this is set to the number of nodes in the network. If a schedule is given, by default, this is set to the number of slots necessary for the schedule. If this parameter value is given, it must be at least as large as the aforementioned default values or an error will be produced. In addition, the number of slots per frame must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 2000.
TDMA-NUM-SLOTS-PER-FRAME 10
# specifies an additional delay for messages sent by the MAC layer to the phy layer.  Some MAC protocols use a multiple of this value.

DUMMY-ROUTING DYNAMIC
ROUTING-PROTOCOL AODV

AODV-NODE-TRAVERSAL-TIME 40MS
# Timeout time for an active route; each time a data packet is received, the lifetime of that route is updated to this value.  A default value of 10 seconds is suggested for error detection through MAC layer message (like what 802.11 does)
AODV-ACTIVE-ROUTE-TIMEOUT 3S
# The destination of a RREQ replies with AODV-MY-ROUTE-TIMEOUT as the lifetime of the route.

AODV-ALLOWED-HELLO-LOSS 2
# Specifies the number of times AODV will repeat expanded ring search for a destination if no Route Reply is received within specified amount of time.
AODV-RREQ-RETRIES 2
# A constant use for calculating the time after which an active route should be deleted.  After timeout of an active route, the route is finally deleted from the routing table after a time period of (K * max (AODV-ACTIVE_ROUTE_TIMEOUT, AODV-ALLOWED_HELLO_LOSS * AODV-HELLO_INTERVAL)), Here K is AODV-ROUTE-DELETION-CONSTANT.

# If the value is set to YES, a node will send a hello message if there is no broadcast within the last hello interval. Simulation time will increase depending on the frequency of the hello updates.

# If this value is set to YES, the node will try to locally repair a broken route, if possible.

# If the source node of a route gets a route error message, it will initiate a new Route Request for the destination if the value is set to YES.
AODV-SEARCH-BETTER-ROUTE NO
# Maximum number of packets the message buffer of AODV can hold. If the buffer fills up, incoming packets for the buffer will be dropped.
