PURPOSE:-
--------
To check data packets are properly routed to the destination within its own group.


SCENARIO:-
---------
It is again a simple topology consisting of 4 nodes in 2 groups. Here nodes have two
interfaces each and therefore each logical group forms two subnets. The nodes are located
along a straight line with sufficient inter-group separation relative to the separation
between individual nodes. There is no mobility.Each subnet communicates over a specific
channel.

(1) :  Represents a node, and the number itself indicates the nodeId.


       <subnet1>                     <subnet3>
        |     |                       |    |
       (1)   (2)                     (3)  (4)
        |     |                       |    |
       <subnet2>                     <subnet4>
