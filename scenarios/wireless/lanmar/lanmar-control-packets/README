PURPOSE:-
--------
To check proper sending of control packets by each node in a typical setup.


SCENARIO:-
---------
This is a simple scenario consisting of 8 nodes in two groups, each in one subnet.The nodes
are located along a straight line with sufficient inter-group separation relative to the
separation between individual nodes. There is no mobility.

(1) :  Represents a node, and the number itself indicates the nodeId.




      (1)- -(2)- -(3)- -(4)          (5)- -(6)- -(7)- -(8)

        <subnet1>                           <subnet2>
