PURPOSE:-
----------------

        To check how the mact message is generated and forwarded
 
 SCENARIO:-
 ----------------
 
        There are total 9 nodes in wired network and and MACT message should generate in node 5 and and forarded through the path.

                                                                        ( 1 )
                                                                        /    \
                                                                     ( 2 )    ( 3 )
                                                                    /          /     \
                                                                  /           /       \
                                                             ( 4 )         ( 5 )    ( 9 )
                                                            /               /    \                  
                                                         ( 6 )          ( 7 )   ( 8)
                                             
        MCBR is used to transfer 180 data segments of 512 bytes each at 10 sec
        intervals starting at 10 sec of the simulation time. Only node 6 is sending 
        data:
               MCBR 6 225.0.0.0 180 512 100MS 10S 30S
