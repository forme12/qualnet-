PURPOSE:-
----------------

        To check how the group leader is selected in a multicast scenarion
        from more than one node join the group.
 
 SCENARIO:-
 ----------------
 
        There are total 9 nodes in wireless network and group leader will be
        selected from node 1, 3 and 4.

                                                                           ( 1 )
                                                            ( 2 )                   ( 3 )
                                                       
                                                ( 4 )     ( 5 )                    ( 6 )  ( 7 )
                                                  
                                        ( 8 )   ( 9 )
                                             
        MCBR is used to transfer 5 data segments of 512 bytes each at 1 sec
        intervals starting at 10 sec of the simulation time. Only node 9 is sending 
        data:
               MCBR 9 225.0.0.0 5 512 1S 10S 30S.
