PURPOSE:-
----------------

        To check how the RREQ message is generated and forwarded
 
 SCENARIO:-
 ----------------
 
        There are total 2 nodes in wired network.Node 1 and 2 are joined together by wired link. 
        Node 2 becomes multicast group leader for entire simulation period and node 1 joins the group when it starts to send packet.
        Node 1 sending 1 MCBR packets each of 512 bytes size at 10 sec of the simulation as following:

           ( 1 )---------------------------( 2 )
                                             
        
             MCBR 1 225.0.0.0 5 512 1S 10S 0S
                
 RUN:-
 ----
 
        Run '<QUALNET_HOME>/bin/qualnet rreq-join-wired.config'.
 
 
 DESCRIPTION OF THE FILES:-
 -------------------------
