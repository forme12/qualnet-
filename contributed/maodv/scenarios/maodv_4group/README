PURPOSE:-
--------
To check how a node with no valid downstream route behaves, when it 
receives a MACT message with G- flag enabled.


SCENARIO:-
---------
There are total 60 nodes in wireless network.
There are MCBR flows in the scenario from nodes 5, 15, 25 and 35 to multicast 
groups 225.0.0.1, 225.0.0.2, 225.0.0.3 and 225.0.0.4 respectively.
MCBR is used to transfer data segments of 512 bytes each at 0.1 sec
intervals starting at 20 sec to 220 sec of the simulation time.


RUN:-
----
Run '<QUALNET_HOME>/bin/qualnet default.config'.


DESCRIPTION OF THE FILES:-
-------------------------
1. default.app -  QualNet configuration file for application input.
2. default.config - QualNet configuration input file.
3. default.member - QualNet multicast group file.
3. default.expected.stat - QualNet statistics collection.
4. default.nodes - QualNet node position file.
