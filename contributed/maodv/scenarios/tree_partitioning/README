PURPOSE:-
----------------

        To check how Maodv handle the tree partioning.
 
 SCENARIO:-
 ----------------
 
        There are total 9 nodes in wireless network and node 1 and 4 are the group member but 
        after 12 second node 2 will be out of range.So the multicast tree will be partitioned.

                                                                           ( 1 )
                                                            ( 2 )                   ( 3 )
                                                       
                                                ( 4 )     ( 5 )                    ( 6 )  ( 7 )
                                                  
                                        ( 8 )   ( 9 )
                                             
        MCBR is used to transfer 5 data segments of 512 bytes each at 1 sec
        intervals starting at 10 sec of the simulation time. Only node 9 is sending 
        data:
                MCBR 9 225.0.0.0 5 512 1S 10S 30S
                
 RUN:-
 ----
 
        Run '<QUALNET_HOME>/bin/qualnet treePartition-wireless.config'.
