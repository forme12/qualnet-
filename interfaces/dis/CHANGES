QualNet DIS interface CHANGES file

=============================================================================
2008-02-14
=============================================================================

QualNet DIS interface now supported on QualNet 4.5.

Added support for communication effects requests to DIS (same packet formats
as HLA).

=============================================================================
2006-10-11
=============================================================================

From this point, this file will note all changes by source code check-in date
instead of by file name of the source zip file (qualnet-...).

The QualNet DIS interface is now officially supported on QualNet 4.0.

Added support for the DIS-IP-ADDRESS and DIS-EXERCISE-ID parameters.

=============================================================================
qualnet-{3.8,3.9-3.9.5}-dis-2006-05-19
=============================================================================

The QualNet DIS interface is now officially supported on QualNet 3.9.5.

There have been no changes to DIS source code since the last release.

=============================================================================
qualnet-3.{8,9}-dis-2006-04-17
=============================================================================

QualNet DIS interface now supported for QualNet 3.9 as well as 3.8.
- All sample scenarios still contain "VERSION 3.8" in their respective
  .config files, but these scenario currently work fine with QualNet 3.9.

Now compiles on Solaris SPARC. (missing #include files and macro)

Now compiles on Linux. (missing #include file)

Updated RadioSystemType values in .router-models and .hla-radios files so
that they fall within commonly accepted ranges (e.g., radios should have
EntityKind values of 7 indicating a radio, not 1, indicating a platform).

DIS sample scenario:  Removed most PHY and MAC global parameters since they
were unnessary.

There was a bug in (non-DIS parts of) QualNet 3.9 and previous versions,
but fixed in QualNet 3.9.1, where antenna settings in the .router-models file
were ignored.  When this occurred, default values (phy/antenna.h) were used
if the antenna settings were not otherwise configured:
1.5-m antenna height, 0-dBi gain, 0.8-dB efficiency, 0.3-dB mismatch loss,
0.2-dB connection loss, and 0-dB cable loss.

- If you are using QualNet 3.9 or earlier and have antenna settings defined
  in a .router-models file which you would like to use, you will need to
  workaround the bug.  Create an .antenna-models file (sample in
  QUALNET_HOME/bin), reference it from the .config file using the
  ANTENNA-MODEL-CONFIG-FILE parameter, and assign antennas to subnets and
  nodes using the ANTENNA-MODEL setting in the same way it's done for
  ROUTER-MODEL settings.

DIS sample scenario:  Adjusted radio parameters for more realism:
radio frequency, TX power, radio RX sensitivity/threshold values (to default
values), antenna properties (to 5-dBi gain assuming a collinear antenna,
other properties to default values), PHY data-rate, PHY noise factor
(default).

- Both the DIS and HLA versions of the otb-4 scenario have been updated so
  they are now the same (except DIS or HLA may be used).

** Documentation

From this point, further changes to documentation will be logged in the PDF
file.

=============================================================================
qualnet-3.8-dis-2005-07-06
=============================================================================

Moved DIS scenarios from gui/scenarios to addons/dis/scenarios.

** Documentation

Documentation updated for new directory structure.

Replaced runide.exe with runidew.exe to make sure Java GUI detaches from
command line.

** Updates to general QualNet 3.8 source code

External interface: FIXED, UPDATED
  HLA and IPNE external interfaces will now compile together.
  Modified EXTERNAL_ConfigStringPresent() so that it only returns true if
   the parameter value is YES. Previously this function returned true
   regardless of the parameter value.
  Fixed bug in external util mapping code.

Cumulative list of updated QualNet 3.8 files:

Same as previous release.

=============================================================================
qualnet-3.8-dis-2005-05-13
=============================================================================

** Updates to general QualNet 3.8 source code

Backed out all *'d items from previous release to remain consistent with SNT
CVS tree.  To obtain files with these changes, please inquire with
support@scalable-networks.com.  Further notes below:

- The *'d EXTERNAL_ConfigStringPresent() fix was actually not a fix.  Future
versions of source code will have the original behavior.

===============================================================================
qualnet-3.8-dis-2005-04-28
===============================================================================

Initial release.

** Updates to general QualNet 3.8 source code

IPNE: UPDATED
 *Uses presence of "IPNE-CONFIG-FILE" parameter in .config file to activate
   IPNE support (previously, the presence of the "IPNE" parameter was checked).
 *IPNE functions better with mapping function fixes to the generic QualNet
   external interface API.

External interface: FIXED, UPDATED
  Hooks introduced to support QualNet HLA interface.
  Hooks introduced to support QualNet DIS interface.
 *Fixes to external mapping functions that broke IPNE support.
 *Fixed EXTERNAL_ConfigStringPresent() so it would return TRUE if the parameter
   was present in the .config file, regardless of its value.  (Previously, the
   function would only return true if the parameter was present and the value
   was "YES".)
  With the new external interface introduced in QualNet 3.8, QualNet may stall
   forever (e.g., stay at 0% progress) because of a bug in
   GetNextInternalEventTime().  Simulation stalling only seemed to occur when
   the user had defined their own external-interface time functions.  This bug
   has been fixed.
   This problem did not appear to occur when using synchronization with
   wall-clock time (e.g., when EXTERNAL_SetTimeManagementRealTime() is called,
   such as for the HLA and IPNE interfaces).
  Externally generated mobility events now execute at the correct simulation
   time.  Previously, such mobility events may have executed later than they
   should.
  Speed statistic no longer automatically reset to 0.0 when calling
   EXTERNAL_ChangeNode*() functions; last value is used instead, unless
   another value is specified.
  Added EXTERNAL_ChangeNodePositionOrientationAndSpeedAtTime() function.
  Please use the EXTERNAL_ChangeNode*() functions to update mobility instead
   of MOBILITY_InsertANewEvent().  Using both can lead to mobility events
   being dropped and warnings being printed.
  Changes to support optional DIS interface.
  Added hooks for multiple interface types in external.cpp ProcessEvent
   function.  Each interface can now have its own ProcessEvent function.
 *Fixes to EXTERNAL_ActivateNode() and EXTERNAL_DeactivateNode() functions.

Internal note for SNT developers:

* Features marked with a single asterisk indicate changes that have not been
  officially checked into the v3_8 branch or main trunk.
