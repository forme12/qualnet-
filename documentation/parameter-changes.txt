# **************** Please Don't Change This File ****************
#
# This file contains information about parameter related changes
# in various QualNet release versions. QualNet simulator and GUI
# will use this file to provide backward compatibility to scenarios
# created by older QualNet versions. Here, the parameters are
# referred to those parameters in .config file or router model
# config file. One potentially can use information listed in
# this file to manually upgrade an old scenario to newer QualNet
# versions. However, QualNet provides a tool to do so.
#
# The information are organized with following keywords:
#
# 1. REPLACE   <old-parameter-name>    <new-parameter-name>
#    This means any occurrence of parameter with name as <old-parameter-name>
#     will be replaced with the new name <new-parameter-name>
#
# 2. IGNORE    <parameter-name>
#    This means the parameter with name <parameter-name> is not used
#    by later QualNet versions anymore. One should remove any occurrence of
#    this parameter. QualNet simulator and GUI will ignore this parameter
#    when parse the scenario configuration file.
#
# 3. VALUE_TO_QUALIFIER    <parameter-name>
#    This means the format of the parameter has been changed from
#        <parameter-name>    <list of node IDs>
#    to new format
#        [NodeId] <parameter-name>    YES | NO
#
# 4. VALUE_TO_QUALIFIER    <old-parameter-name>    <new-parameter-name>
#    This means the format of the parameter has been changed from
#        <old-parameter-name>    <list of node IDs>
#    to new format
#        [NodeId] <new-parameter-name>    YES | NO
#


#
# The following parameter changes are for QualNet from 4.5 to 5.0
#
REPLACE OSPFv2_ADVRT_SELF_INTF OSPFv2-ADVRT-SELF-INTF
IGNORE DUMMY-MAC-DOT11-SET-MESH-PARAMETERS
VALUE_TO_QUALIFIER H323-GATEKEEPER
VALUE_TO_QUALIFIER SIP-PROXYLIST SIP-PROXY


#
# The following parameter changes are for Qualnet prior to 4.5
#

#
# MAC802.11 related parameters have been changed from the format
# MAC802.11-xxx to MACDOT11-xxx. However, such changes were handled
# in source files directly for backward compatibility.
#


#
# The following parameter changes are for JNE 4.0
#
# MOBILITY-STATISTICS is officially deprecated inside the code.
IGNORE MOBILITY-STATISTICS
